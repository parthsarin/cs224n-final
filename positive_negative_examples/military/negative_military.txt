Based on previous research from the Office of Naval Research, 
We would like to thank the Disruptive Technology Office (DTO), under DOD/DOI/ARDA
Referring to research published from the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense
We have shared our data with the DOD and DOI (but did not receive funding from them)We looked at prior DERA data
