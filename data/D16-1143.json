First, we collect the describing words of currently popular videos, including video names, actor names and video keywords, from video websites. Secondly, we search these describing words in users' microblogs, and build the direct relationships between users and the appeared words. After that, to make the sparse relationship denser, we propose a Bayesian method to calculate the probability of connections between users and other video describing words. Lastly, we build two models to predict users' demographics with the obtained direct and indirect relationships. Based on a large realworld dataset, experiment results show that our method can significantly improve these words' demographic predictive ability. Introduction Recent studies have indicated that users' demographics can be predicted from their linguistic characteristics. A typical practice is cutting the text into a bag of words and training a linear classifier. Although this practice can achieve an acceptable result in simple tasks such as predicting gender and age, it loses some important information about the text structure and does not fully use the relationship between words. Nowadays, people spend a lot of time on videos and social media which provide them with access to post views and comments. Weibo is one of the biggest microblogging platforms in China. More than one third of the \"Weibo Trends\" 1 are about videos. Generally, people with different demographic attributes usually have different tastes for videos (Abisheva et al., 2014) . For example, in China people who watch English drama tend to be welleducated. Here is a question: if the video related information in users' weibo messages can be fully used, will the users' demographic prediction be improved? One challenge is that many users do not directly mention the video names in their weibo messages. Instead, they make comments on the actors or the plots. If a person likes \"Big Bang Theory\", he may post \"Will the Big Bang Theory last into the next century?\" where the sitcom's name is mentioned directly, or \"Sheldon is so cool, I love him!\" which talks about an actor of the sitcom. Both posts indicate the user is interested in \"Big Bang Theory\". When involving the demographic prediction, however, the traditional \"bag of words based\" model cannot extract the above information effectively. Some previous works use topic models such as LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001) or LDA (Blei et al., 2003) to detect the relations among users' words. Usually, they suffer from the short length of weibo messages and the number of topics. In addition, the lifespan of most popular video programs is not very long, which renders traditional topic models inefficient. Fortunately, there exist some third-party video websites, such as youtube.com and youku.com, from which we can get the most popular videos. For each video, there is usually a homepage with a actor list and also a comments section, and we can calculate the video's Top TF-IDF words (keywords) based on these comments. Here we define the video name, actor name and keyword to be three different kinds of \"video describing words\". The relationships among these words can be used to better understand weibo users' video related behaviors. This approach can be applied to other kinds of words, such as describing words on books and music. This paper focuses on the video as an example. After obtaining the video describing words, we build three matrices to represent the direct and indirect relationships between weibo users and these words. They are User-Video Matrix, User-Actor Matrix and User-Keyword Matrix, respectively. At beginning, these three matrices are sparse because they only represent the direct relationships, which means that only when the words appear in user's weibos, the corresponding position will be set. After that, we propose a \"hidden layer\" to detect the indirect relationships, making them denser. With these indirect relationships, we can improve users' demographic predictions, including gender, age, education background, and marital status. This paper makes the followings three contributions: 1. By construct three matrices, we detect the direct and indirect relationships between weibo users and video describing words. 2. Two models are proposed to predict users' demographics by using both direct and indirect relationships. 3. Experiment results prove that our efforts can significantly improve the predictive accuracy, compared with the existing research. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the dataset and demographics. Section 3 introduces how to make full use of video related behaviors. Section 4 presents experimental results. Finally, we review related work in Section 5, and draw conclusions in Section 6. Dataset and Demographics Dataset We collected 2,970,642 microblog users from Weibo (http://weibo.com), the largest microblog service in China, as our dataset. To avoid spam users (sometimes called robot users), we only collected verified users and users followed by verified user. Weibo conducts manual verifications to make sure the verified users provide real and authentic profile information. Table 1 presents four target demographic attributes and the completion rates (ratio of effective users). All data is either through Open API or publicly available. No private data is used in the experiment. We also collected 847 popular video programs from YISQ (4 popular video websites in China: youku, iqiyi, sohu, qq). These videos mainly fall into three types: movie, tv play, and variety shows. We downloaded these videos' Homepages and extracted their actors and TOP20 TF-IDF words. The statistics are shown in Table 2 . Ground Truth One problem of our dataset is it contains celebrities, while our model mainly targets ordinary weibo users. We implement a filter to exclude celebrities based on their large numbers of followers (>50000 as default), making the ground truth more representative. Besides, users with less than 100 messages are discarded. At last, we obtain 742,323 accounts with both their demographics and messages. Demographics As Table 1 shows, the demographic attributes concerned in this paper include gender, age, education background, and marital status: Gender (Binary): the gender prediction is a typical binary classification task: male, female. Age (4-Class): because there is only a handful of(<1%) user older than 45, we classify users into the following four age groups: Teenage (<18), Youngster (18-24), Young (25-34), Mid-age (>34). Education Background (Binary): we categorize users' education background into two groups: university, non-university. Marital Status (Binary): marital status is also simplified to a binary classification task: single, non-single. Our Model In this section, we introduce the framework, which contains four steps.  The first step generates the \"Video describing words\" and represents user as two vectors (V v , V o ). V v consists of user's \"video describing words\" and V o consists of user's \"other words\". At first, V v only contains user's direct relationships. V v : video describing words (direct) V o : other words V a : V v + V o The second step detects the indirect relationships between users and videos. For example, if a user mentioned \"Robert Downey Jr\", we believe he has an indirect relationships with \"Iron Man\" movie. By doing so, we add user's indirect relationships into his V v , getting a denser vector V v . V v : video describing words (direct+indirect) V a : V v + V o The third step proposes two models respectively to evaluate whether those indirect relationships, discovered in second step, can be used to develop a more accurate prediction model. The fourth step represents weibo user with the combination of V v and V o , and use the combination to train a linear SVM to evaluate whether this effort can make the prediction better. Discover Indirect Relationships If a user mentioned a video's name directly, we believe there is a direct relationship between them. The rests are unobvious relationships. In this part, we calculate whether these unobvious relationships can be transformed into indirect ones. User-Video Matrix Firstly, we detect whether a user directly mentioned a video program in his weibo messages. There are two scenarios: the first is this user posts a message containing the video's name directly, and the other is this user reposts a message containing the video's name. In this paper, we believe these two scenarios both indicate there is a direct relationship between the user and the video, and do not make a distinction between them. Till now, we construct a Direct User-Video Matrix (DUVM) to denote all the direct relationships between users and videos. Step 1: We know each video program v n contains some actors a nj and keywords w ni . We can calculate P (v n ), P (a nj |v n ) and P (w ni |v n ) in Step 1. P (v n ) represents the probability that a person has watched the n th video. P (w ni |v n ) represents the probability that a person, who has watched the n th video, mention the ni th keyword. P (a nj |v n ) is the probability that a person, who has watched the n th video, mention the nj th actor. Step 2: In step 2, If a user doesn't mention a video's name directly, but mentions the video's related actors (A k ) and keywords (W m ), we can update his unobvious user-video relationships according to a Bayesian framework. (3)Two models are proposed to predict users demographics by using both direct and indirect relationships. P (v n ) = num ( P (v n |W m , A k ) = P (W m , A k |v n ) * P (v n ) P (W m , A k ) = wni\u2208Wm P (w ni |v n ) * anj \u2208A k P (a nj |v n ) * P (v n ) P (W m , A k ) (1) Through Step 2, we can discover some new indirect relationships and update UVM. Go back to Step 1 and iterate until converges, we can get the Final UVM at last. User-Actor Matrix Every video program has several actors, and the relationships between weibo users and actors may contribute to the demographic prediction either. So we build the UAM, where each row represents a weibo user and each column represents an actor. There are two case that the element of UAM will be set to true: (1) the user 'i' directly mentioned actor 'j' in his weibo messages (including post and repost); (2) the user 'i' has watched video 'v', and actor 'j' participate in video 'v'. The second case needs UVM's help. We suppose these two cases affect the value equally in this paper. User-Keyword Matrix We can find several keywords to describe each video from their Homepages. For instance, we get \"Paul Walker\", \"fight\", and \"car\" to describe \"Furious 7\". Each row of UKM represents a weibo user and each column represents a keyword of a certain video. (1) If we find a user has watched the \"Furious 7\", no matter direct or indirect relationship, we can set the columns of user's \"Furious 7\" keywords to true. (2) The value can be set to true either if the user directly mentioned these keywords. Two Indirect Relationship Based Models In this part, two models are proposed to predict users' demographics by using both direct and indirect relationships. Discriminant Model (Dis-Model) Given three matrices, the intuitive way to predict users' demographics is using Collaborative Filtering. However, finding the similar users directly based on the vector similarity is not a good idea, because a substantial part of users have ever watched no more than 10 videos. Matrix Factorization has been proven useful to address data sparsity, for the reduced orthogonal dimensions are less noisy than the original data and can capture the latent associations between users and videos. In our Dis-Model, we utilize the factorization machines (Rendle, 2010) to deal with UVM, UAM, and UKM, reducing the length of user's dimensionality from videos' number (actors' number, keywords' number) to a smaller value K. Every weibo user can be represented by the combination of these three Klength vectors. Over the last several decades, many kinds of discriminant classifier have been created. For our four tasks, we compared Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT). Figure 2 illustrates their performance, where GBDT performs the best in all K values. When K increases from 5 to 20, all classifiers' results are all getting better and tend to be stable when K is bigger than 20. So we choose GBDT as our default base classifier and K=20 as default value. Generative Model (Gen-Model) We start with introducing an important concept: video demographic tendency, which means to what extent a video belongs to a specified demographic group. For example, if 90% audiences of a movie are males, we define its demographic tendency on male as 90%. The actor tendency and keyword tendency can be calculated in the same way. In the Gen-Model, (1) we firstly calculate each video's (actor, keyword) demographic tendency according to its audiences (known demographics). (2) Based on the demographic tendency of videos (actors, keywords), we predict user's (unknown) demographics via a Bayesian method. (3) At last, we propose a smooth step to adjust the result. (1) Calculate video demographic tendency At first, we calculate every video demographic tendency as Equation 2 : p(c|v j ) = n i=1 (r ij * u i (c)) n i=1 r ij (2) P (c|v j ) represents the j th video's demographic tendency on c, where c is the demographic attribute. r ij will be set to 1 if the i th user has watched the j th video, otherwise set to 0. u i (c) is a boolean, representing whether the i th user has the attribute c. (2) Calculate user demographic attribute In this step, we predict users' demographics according to the demographic tendency of the videos they has watched. Suppose user's viewing habits are independent, we can calculate the probability of P (c|u i ) as Equation 3 : P (c|u i ) \u221d P (c|{V }) \u221d P ({V }|c) * P (c) \u221d vj \u2208{V } P (v j |c) * P (c) = vj \u2208{V } P (c|v j ) * P (v j ) P (c) * P (c) \u221d vj \u2208{V } P (c|v j ) (3) {V } represents the collection of videos watched by u i . P (c|v j ) is the j th video's demographic tendency on c, as the previous part described. (3) Smooth the result Based on the fact that people in same demographic group may have similar behaviors, we deploy a smooth component to adjust the value of P (c|v j ) and P (c|u i ) according to their top n neighbors. As mentioned above, we use factorization machines to transform the user and video vectors into lowdimensional (K=20) ones. The distance is calculated by Euclidean Distance. The video, actor, and word have the same treating process, so we introduce the video as representative. Smooth the Video's Demographic Tendency: Base on video v j 's top n neighbors, we can calculate its neighbors' average demographic tendency P (c|nbr(v j )), where P (c|v nbj ) is v j 's nbj th neighbor's demographic tendency. p(c|nbr(v j )) = n j=1 P (c|v nbj ) n (4) Therefore, we can smooth v j 's demographic tendency by: P (c|v j ) = \u03b1 * P (c|v j ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) * P (c|nbr(v j )) (5) \u03b1 is the parameter to control the top n neighbors' influence. In this paper, we compared ten values of \u03b1 and chose 0.7 as default. With the same process, n is set to 10 as default. Smooth the User's Demographic Result: The user side smooth procedure is similar to the video side, except user's P (c|nbr(u i )) is affected by three kinds of neighbors (u nbvi , u nbai , u nbwi ). p(c|nbr(u i )) = n i=1 P (c|u nbvi ) 3n + n i=1 P (c|u nbai ) 3n + n i=1 P (c|u nbwi ) 3n (6) Just like video's smooth process, we adjust u i 's demographic attributes by: P (c|u i ) = \u03b1 * P (c|u i ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) * P (c|nbr(u i )) (7) The smooth component is deployed as an iterative procedure, and keeps running until each P (c|u i ) became stable. Two Baselines: To validate whether those indirect relationships can improve the predictions, we build two baseline models: Dis-Baseline and Gen-Baseline. While our two models use the V v as input, these two baseline models use the raw V v . These two baseline models adopt the same architecture with our proposed two models. The only difference is the input data. Fusion Model As described above, we discovered the indirect relationships between users and video describing words, and demonstrated this effort can leading a better result than directly train the classifier.  But pre-existing models commonly utilize all the words in user's weibo messages. So we need to find out whether our hard-earned improvement would be submerged by those \"Non video describing words\". We train a Fusion Model using all the words in weibo messages and indirect relationships together, and compare it with a baseline model, who only use all the words (without indirect relationships). Fusion Baseline: Many pre-existing methods (Burger et al., 2011; Tu et al., 2015) chose linear model as their text classifier, for linear model is suitable for text categorization tasks. We choose L1-regularized linear SVM as our Fusion Model and Fusion-Baseline's classifier. The only difference between them is the input data (V v + V o vs V v + V o ). Experiment Results We conducted a 10-fold cross validation to demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, where 8 parts for training, 1 parts for validation and 1 parts for testing by default. The performance of presented methods were evaluated using the Precision, Recall and Macro-F1 measures. Binary classification tasks were also measured by Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Indirect Relationships Evaluation In our dataset, each user directly mention 2.6 video programs on average and only 0.7% has more than 10 direct relationships. As shown in Figure 3 , more and more indirect relationships arise along with the iterations. User's relationship number (direct + indirect) stabilized at 5.7 on average and 13% of them is bigger than 10. To answer whether these indirect relationships  can make the prediction better, we compared our two models (Dis-Model & Gen-Model) with two baseline models. We also compared their performance on different user groups categorized by user-video relationship number. Gender: As Table 3 shows, our two models both have a significant improvement compared to the baseline models. The Gen-Model achieve the best performance (AUC 0.825) in terms of all the measurement. As Figure 4 (a) shows, with the number growth, our two models' AUC scores are both getting better. Surprisingly, when the number is bigger than 10, the Gen-Model even get a similar performance of the model using all of the user's words. Age: In the age task, our two models both outperformed the baseline models significantly, and the generative model performs better (F1 0.654) too. We analyzed the result and found the \"youngster\" and \"young\" share the similar watching habits in Weibo. It's hard to pick out a 23 years old user from the 28 years old group. As Figure 4 (b) shows, our two models' F1 scores are both getting better along with the growth of user-video relationship number. Education Background: Not surprisingly, our two models obviously outperform the result over two baseline models. This result indicates that people in different education background has visible different tastes on video programs. Marital Status: Table 3 presents the results of marital status. We notice that the performance of our two model is still reasonable, but is worse than gender and education tasks. In addition to that this task is more difficulty, another reason is when a user gets married, he might not update the information in his online profile. Remark: Experiment results show that our method can significantly improve these words' demographic predictive ability by more than 15% on average. 10 videos is good enough to portray a weibo user, and can achieve reasonable results in these 4 inference tasks. The video related behavior is efficient on predicting gender and education, for people on these two tasks have visible different inclinations. Inferring age and marital status is not easy, but our two models still achieve reasonable improvements. In general, our two models both get significantly better results than baselines. The Gen-Model is a better choice by contrast. Fusion Model Evaluation After we obtained the potential predictive ability of indirect relationships, we also need to find out whether it can help pre-existing model perform better. We compare the Fusion Baseline (V v +V o ) with our Fusion Model (V v +V o ). As Figure 5 shows, Fusion Model's performance is better than Fusion Baseline's in all four tasks. The improvement is about 2-3% on average. As above mentioned, our approach can be applied to other kinds of words, such as describing words on books and music. So there is some room for improvement. Related work In this section, we briefly review the research works related to our work. Many researches (Kumar and Tomkins, 2010; Goel et al., 2012) found users belong to different demographic groups behave differently. (Hu et al., 2007; Murray and Durrell, 2000; Goel et al., 2012; Kosinski et al., 2012) showed that age, gender, education level, and even personality can be predicted from people's webpage browsing logs. (Kosinski et al., 2013; Schwartz et al., 2013; Youyou et al., 2015) showed computers' judgments of people's personalities based on their Facebook Likes are more accurate and valid than judgments made by their close acquaintances. (Malmi and Weber, 2016) showed users' demographics also can be predicted based on theirs apps. Apart from the browsing behaviors, there also exist some works based on user's linguistic characteristics. (Schler et al., 2006) analyzed tens of thousands of blogs and indicated significant differences in writing style and word usage between different gender and age groups. The similar result also showed in (Luyckx and Daelemans, 1998; Oberlander and Nowson, 2006; Mairesse et al., 2007; Nowson, 2007; Gill et al., 2009; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011) . There are some works (Bi et al., 2013; Weber and Jaimes, 2011; Weber and Castillo, 2010) on predicting search engine user's demographics based on their search queries. (Hovy, 2015) investigated the influence of user's demographics on better understanding their online reviews. (Otterbacher, 2010) used logistic regression model to infer users gender based on the content of movie reviews. Many researches focused on the twitter users. In the Author Profiling task at PAN 2015 (Rangel et al., 2015) , participants approached the task of identifying age, gender and personality traits from Twitter. (Nguyen et al., 2013) explored users' age prediction task based on their tweets, achieving better performance than humans. (Burger et al., 2011) studied the gender predictive ability of twitter linguistic characteristics, reached 92% accuracy. (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011) proposed a GB-DT model to predict users' age, gender, political orientation and ethnicity by leveraging their observable information. (Culotta et al., 2015) predicted the demographics of Twitter users based on whom they follow, and (Zhong et al., 2015) predicted the microblog user's demographic attributes only by their chick-ins. In (Li et al., 2014) , job and education attributes are extracted by combining a rule based approach with a probabilistic system. There are also some works based on users' social relationships (Mislove et al., 2010; Henderson et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2013) . Conclusion Our motivation on writing this paper is user's video related behavior is usually under-utilized on demographic prediction tasks. With the help of third-party video sites, we detect the direct and calculate the indirect relationships between users and video describing words, and demonstrate this effort can improve the accuracy of users' demographic predictions. To our knowledge, this is the first work which explores demographic prediction by fully using users' video describing words. This framework has good scalability and can be applied on other concrete features, such as user's book reading behaviors and music listening behaviors. Acknowledgments",
