Introduction In English, a noun can be countable or uncountable. Countable nouns can be \"counted\", they have a singular and plural form. For example: an apple, two apples, three apples. Uncountable nouns cannot be counted. This means they have only a singular form, such as water, rice, wine. Countability is the semantic property that determines whether a noun can occur in singular and plural forms. We can obtain the information about countability of individual nouns easily from grammar books or dictionaries. Several researchers have explored automatically learning the countability of English nouns (Bond and Vatikiotis-Bateson, 2002; Schwartz, 2002; Baldwin and Bond, 2003) . However, all the proposed approaches focused on learning the countability of individual nouns. A compound noun is a noun that is made up of two or more words. Most compound nouns in English are formed by nouns modified by other nouns or adjectives. In this paper, we concentrate solely on compound nouns made up of only two words, as they account for the vast majority of compound nouns. There are three forms of compound words: the closed form, in which the words are melded together, such as \"songwriter\", \"softball\", \"scoreboard\"; the hyphenated form, such as \"daughter-in-law\", \"master-at-arms\"; and the open form, such as \"post office\", \"real estate\", \"middle class\". Compound words create special problems when we need to know their countability. According to \"Guide to English Grammar and Writing\", the base element within the compound noun will generally function as a regular noun for the countability, such as \"Bedrooms\". However this rule is highly irregular. Some uncountable nouns occur in their plural forms within compound nouns, such as \"mineral waters\" (water is usually considered as uncountable noun). The countability of some words changes when occur in different compound nouns. \"Rag\" is countable noun, while \"kentish rag\" is uncountable; \"glad rags\" is plural only. \"Wages\" is plural only, but \"absolute wage\" and \"standard wage\" are countable. So it is obvious that determining countability of a compound noun should take all its elements into account, not consider solely on the base word. The number of compound nouns is so large that it is impossible to collect all of them in one dictionary, which also need to be updated frequently, for newcoined words are being created continuously, and most of them are compound nouns, such as \"leisure sickness\", \"Green famine\". Knowledge of countability of compound nouns is very important in English text generation. The research is motivated by our project: post-edit translation candidates in machine translation. In Baldwin and Bond (2003) , they also mentioned that many languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, do not mark countability, so how to determine the appropriate form of translation candidates is depend on the knowledge of countability. For example, the correct translation for \"\u53d1\u80b2\u6027\u75db 1 \" is \"growing pains\", not \"growing pain\". In this paper, we learn the countability of English compound nouns using WWW as a large corpus. For many compound nouns, especially the relatively new words, such as genetic pollution, have not yet reached any dictionaries. we believe that using the web-scale data can be a viable alternative to avoid the sparseness problem from smaller corpora. We classified compound nouns into three classes: countable (eg., bedroom), uncountable (eg,. cash money), plural only (eg,. crocodile tears). To detect which class a compound noun is, we proposed some simple, viable n-gram models, such as freq(N) (the frequency of the singular form of the noun) whose parameters' values (web hits of literal queries) can be obtained with the help of WWW search engine Google. The detecting thresholds (a noun whose value of parameter is above the threshold is considered as plural only) are estimated on the small countability-tagged training set. Finally we evaluated our detecting approach on a test set and showed that our algorithm based on the simple models performed the promising results. Querying in WWW adds noise to the data, we certainly lose some precision compared to supervised statistical models, but we assume that the size of the WWW will compensate the rough queries. Keller and Lapata (2003) also showed the evidence of the reliability of the web counts for natural language processing. In (Lapata and Keller, 2005) , they also investigated the countability leaning task for nouns. However they only distinguish between countable and uncountable for individual nouns. The best model is the determiner-noun model, which achieves 88.62% on countable and 91.53% on uncountable nouns. In section 2 of the paper, we describe The main approach used in the paper. The preparation of the training and test data is introduced in section 3. The details of the experiments and results are presented in section 4. Finally, in section 5 we list our conclusions. Our approach We classified compound nouns into three classes, countable, uncountable and plural only. In Baldwin and Bond (2003) , they classified individual nouns into four possible classes. Besides the classes mentioned above, they also considered bipartite nouns. These words can only be plural when they head a noun phrase (trousers), but singular when used as a modifier (trouser leg). We did not take this class into account in the paper, for the bipartite words is very few in compound nouns. C-noun Figure 1. Detecting processing flow For plural only compound noun, we assume that the frequency of the word occurrence in the plural form is much larger than that in the singular form, while for the uncountable noun, the frequency in the singular form is much larger than that in the plural form. The main processing flow is shown in Figure 1 . In the figure, \"Cnoun\" and \"Ns\" mean compound noun and the plural form of the word respectively. \"F(Ns)>>F(N)\" means that the frequency of the plural form of the noun is much larger than that of the singular form. In (1), we use the frequency of a word in the plural form against that in the singular form. \u03b8 is the detecting threshold above which the word can be considered as a plural only. In (2), we use the frequency of a word in the singular form co-occurring with the determiner \"much\" against the frequency of the word in the plural form with many, if above \u03b8 , the word can be considered as uncountable word. ( 2 ) is used to distinguish between countable and uncountable compound nouns. \u03b8 \u2265 ) , ( ) , ( is N f are Ns f (3) The model 3 that compares the frequencies of noun-be pairs (eg,. f(\"account books are\"), f(\"account book is\") is used to distinguish plural only and countable compound nouns. With the help of WWW search engine Google, the frequencies (web hits) in the models can be obtained using quoted n-gram queries (\"soft surroundings\"). Although in Keller and Lapata (2002) , they experimentally showed that web-based approach can overcome data sparseness for bigrams, but the problem still exists in our experiments. When the number of pages found is zero, we smooth zero hits by adding them to 0.01. Countable compound nouns create some problems when we need to pluralize them. For no real rules exist for how to pluralize all the words, we summarized from \"Guide to English Grammar and Writing\" for some trends. We processed our experimental data following the rules below. 1. Pluralize the last word of the compound noun. Eg,. bedrooms, film stars. 2. When \"woman\" or \"man\" are the modifiers in the compound noun, pluralize both of the words. Eg,. Women-drivers. 3. When the compound noun is made up as \"noun + preposition (or prep. phrase)\", pluralize the noun. Eg,. fathers-in-law. 4. When the compound noun is made up as \"verb (or past participle) + adverb\", plu-ralize the last word. Eg,. grown-ups, stand-bys. Although the rules cannot adapt for each compound noun, in our experimental data, all the countable compound nouns follow the rules. We are sure that the rules are viable for most countable compound nouns. Although we used Google as our search engine, we did not use Google Web API service for programme realization, for Google limits to 1000 automated queries per day. As we just need web hits returned for each search query, we extracted the numbers of hits from the web pages found directly. Experimental Data The main experimental data is from Webster's New International Dictionary (Second Edition). The list of compound words of the dictionary is available in the Internet 2 . We selected the compound words randomly from the list and keep the nouns, for the word list also mixes compound verbs and adjectives with nouns together. We repeated the process several times until got our experimental data. We collected 3000 words for the training which is prepared for optimizing the detecting thresholds, and 500 words for the test set which is used to evaluate our approach. In the sets we added 180 newcoined compound nouns (150 for training; 30 for test). These relatively new words that were created over the past seven years have not yet reached any dictionaries 3 . Countability Training We manually annotated the countability of these compound nouns, plural only, countable, uncountable. An English teacher who is a native speaker has checked and corrected the annotations. The make-up of the experimental data is listed in Table 1 . Experiments and Results Detecting plural only compound nouns Plural only compound nouns that have not singular forms always occur in plural forms. The frequency of their singular forms should be zero. Considering the noise data introduced by search engine, we used model ( 1 ) and (3) in turn to detect plural noun. We detected plural only compound nouns with the following algorithm (Figure 2 ), which is used to distinguish between plural only and non-plural only compound. We use Recall and Precision to evaluate the performance with the different threshold pairs. The fundamental Recall/Precision definition is adapted to IE system evaluation. We borrowed the measures using the following definition for our evaluation. For one experiment with a certain threshold pair, A stands for the number of plural found correctly; AB stands for the total number of plural only compound nouns in training set (80 words); AC stands for the total number of compound nouns found. The Recall and Precision are defined in (4) and (5). We also introduced F-score when we need consider the Recall and Precision at the same time, and in the paper, F-score is calculated according to (6). Figure 3 shows the performance evaluated by the three measures when \u03b8 1=8 and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 2 \u2264 10 with a stepsize of 1. We set \u03b8 2 to 5 for the test later, and accordingly the values of Recall, Precision and F-score are 91.25%, 82.95% and 87.40% respectively. The algorithm detecting uncountable compound nouns is shown in Figure 4 . Using model ( 1 ) and (2), we attempted to fully make use of the characteristic of uncountable compound nouns, that is the frequencies of their occurrence in the singular forms are much larger than that in the plural forms. The method to obtain the optimal threshold \u03b8 3 and \u03b8 4 is the same to 4.1. We set \u03b8 3 to 24, \u03b8 4 to 2, and the values of Recall, Precision and F-score are 88.38%, 80.27% and 84.13% respectively. Performance on the test suite We evaluated our complete algorithm with the four thresholds ( \u03b8 Conclusion From the results, we show that simple unsupervised web-based models can achieve the promising results on the test data. For we roughly adjusted the threshold with stepsize of 1, better performance is expected with stepsize of such as 0.1. It is unreasonable to compare the detecting results of individual and compound nouns with each other since using web-based models, compound nouns made up of two or more words are more likely to be affected by data sparseness, while individual nouns are prone to produce more noise data because of their high occurrence frequencies. Anyway using WWW is an exciting direction for NLP, how to eliminate noise data is the key to improve web-based methods. Our next step is aiming at evaluating the internet resource, distinguishing the useful and noise data.",
