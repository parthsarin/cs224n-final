A MWE typically expresses concepts and ideas that usually cannot be expressed by a single word. Intuitively, with the appropriate treatment of MWEs, the results of an Information Retrieval (IR) system could be improved. The aim of this paper is to apply techniques for the automatic extraction of MWEs from corpora to index them as a single unit. Experimental results show improvements on the retrieval of relevant documents when identifying MWEs and treating them as a single indexing unit. Introduction One of the motivations of this work is to investigate if the identification and appropriate treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an application contributes to improve results and ultimately lead to more precise man-machine interaction. The term \"multiword expression\" has been used to describe a large set of distinct constructions, for instance support verbs, noun compounds, institutionalized phrases and so on. Calzolari et al. (2002) defines MWEs as a sequence of words that acts as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis. The nature of MWEs can be quite heterogeneous and each of the different classes has specific characteristics, posing a challenge to the implementation of mechanisms that provide unified treatment for them. For instance, even if a standard system capable of identifying boundaries between words, i.e. a tokenizer, may nevertheless be incapable of recognizing a sequence of words as an MWEs and treating them as a single unit if necessary (e.g. to kick the bucket meaning to die). For an NLP application to be effective, it requires mechanisms that are able to identify MWEs, handle them and make use of them in a meaningful way (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin et al., 2003) . It is estimated that the number of MWEs in the lexicon of a native speaker of a language has the same order of magnitude as the number of single words (Jackendoff, 1997) . However, these ratios are probably underestimated when considering domain-specific language, in which the specialized vocabulary and terminology are composed mostly by MWEs. In this paper, we perform an application-oriented evaluation of the inclusion of MWE treatment into an Information Retrieval (IR) system. IR systems aim to provide users with quick access to data they are interested (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999) . Although language processing is not vital to modern IR systems, it may be convenient (Sparck Jones, 1997) and in this scenario, NLP techniques may contribute in the selection of MWEs for indexing as single units in the IR system. The selection of appropriate indexing terms is a key factor for the quality of IR systems. In an ideal system, the index terms should correspond to the concepts found in the documents. If indexing is performed only with the atomic terms, there may be a loss of semantic content of the documents. For example, if the query was pop star meaning celebrity, and the terms were indexed individually, the relevant documents may not be retrieved and the system would return instead irrelevant documents about celestial bodies or carbonated drinks. In order to investigate the effects of indexing of MWEs for IR, the results of queries are analyzed using IR quality metrics. This paper is structured as follows: in section 2 we discuss briefly MWEs and some of the challenges they represent. This is followed in section 3 by a discussion of the materials and methods employed in this paper, and in section 4 of the evaluation performed. We finish with some conclusions and future work. Multiword Expressions The concept of Multiword Expression has been widely viewed as a sequence of words that acts as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis (Calzolari et al., 2002) , or as Idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces) (Sag et al., 2002) . One of the great challenges of NLP is the identification of such expressions, \"hidden\" in texts of various genres. The difficulties encountered for identifying Multiword Expressions arise for reasons like: \u2022 the difficulty to find the boundaries of a multiword, because the number of component words may vary, or they may not always occur in a canonical sequence (e.g. rock the boat, rock the seemingly intransigent boat and the bourgeois boat was rocked); \u2022 even some of the core components of an MWE may present some variation (e.g. throw NP to the lions/wolves/dogs/?birds/?butterflies); \u2022 in a multilingual perspective, MWEs of a source language are often not equivalent to their word-by-word translation in the target language (e.g. guarda-chuva in Portuguese as umbrella in English and not as ?store rain). The automatic discovery of specific types of MWEs has attracted the attention of many researchers in NLP over the past years. With the recent increase in efficiency and accuracy of techniques for preprocessing texts, such as tagging and parsing, these can become an aid in improving the performance of MWE detection techniques. In terms of practical MWE identification systems, a well known approach is that of Smadja (1993) , who uses a set of techniques based on statistical methods, calculated from word frequencies, to identify MWEs in corpora. This approach is implemented in a lexicographic tool called Xtract. More recently there has been the release of the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al., 2010) for the automatic extraction of MWEs from monolingual corpora, that both generates and validates MWE candidates. As generation is based on surface forms, for the validation, a series of criteria for removing noise are provided, including some (language independent) association measures such as mutual information, dice coefficient and maximum likelihood. Several other researchers have proposed a number of computational techniques that deal with the discovery of MWEs: Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002) for verb-particle constructions, Pearce (2002) and Evert and Krenn (2005) for collocations, Nicholson and Baldwin (2006) for compound nouns and many others. For our experiments, we used some standard statistical measures such as mutual information, pointwise mutual information, chi-square, permutation entropy (Zhang et al., 2006) , dice coefficient, and t-test to extract MWEs from a collection of documents (i.e. we consider the collection of documents indexed by the IR system as our corpus). Materials and Methods Based on the hypothesis that the MWEs can improve the results of IR systems, we carried out an evaluation experiment. The goal of our evaluation is to detect differences between the quality of the standard IR system, without any treatment for MWEs, and the same system improved with the identification of MWEs in the queries and in the documents. In this section we describe the different resources and methods used in the experiments. Resources and Tools For this evaluation we used two large newspaper corpora, containing a high diversity of terms: \u2022 Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, USA -1994) \u2022 The Herald (Glasgow, Scotland -1995) Together, both corpora cover a large set of subjects present in the news published by these newspa-pers in the years listed. The language used is American English, in the case of the Los Angeles Times and British English, in the case of The Herald. Hereafter, the corpus of the Los Angeles Times will be referred as LA94 and The Herald as GH95. Together, they contain over 160,000 news articles ( The collection of documents, as well as the query topics and the list of relevance judgments (which will be discussed afterwards), were prepared in the context of the CLEF 2008 (Cross Language Evaluation Forum), for the task entitled Robust-WSD (Acosta et al., 2008) . This task aimed to explore the contribution of the disambiguation of words to bilingual or monolingual IR. The task was to assess the validity of word-sense disambiguation for IR. Thus, the documents in the corpus have been annotated by a disambiguation system. The structure of a document contains information about the identifier of a term in a document (TERM ID), the lemma of a term (LEMA) and also its morphosyntactic tag (POS). In addition, it contains the form in which the term appeared in the text (WF) and information of the term in the WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998) as SYNSET SCORE and CODE, both not used for the experiment. An example of the representation of a term in the document is shown in Figure 1 . <TERM ID=\"GH950102-000000-126\" LEMA=\"underworld\" POS=\"NN\"> <WF>underworld</WF> <SYNSET SCORE=\"0.5\" CODE=\"06120171-n\"/> <SYNSET SCORE=\"0.5\" CODE=\"06327598-n\"/> </TERM> In this paper, we extracted the terms located in the LEMA attribute, in other words, in their canonical form (e.g. letter bomb for letter bombs). The use of lemmas and not the words (e.g. write for wrote, written, etc.) to the formation of the corpus, avoids linguistic variations that can affect the results of the experiments. As a results, our documents were formed only by lemmas and the next step is the indexing of documents using an IR system. For this task we used a tool called Zettair (Zettair, 2008) , which is a compact textual search engine that can be used both for the indexing and for querying text collections. Porter's Stemmer (Porter, 1997) as implemented in Zettair was also used. Stemming can provide further conflation of related terms. For example, bomb and bombing were not merged in the lemmatized texts but after stemming they are conflated to a single representation. After indexing, the next step is the preparation of the query topics. Just as the corpus, only the lemmas of the query topics were extracted and used. The test collection has a total of 310 query topics. The judgment of whether a document is relevant to a query was assigned according to a list of relevant documents, manually prepared and supplied with the material provided by CLEF. We used Zettair to generate the ranked list of documents retrieved in response to each query. For each query topic, the 1,000 top scoring documents were selected. We used the cosine metric to calculate the scores and rank the documents. Finally, to calculate the retrieval evaluation metrics (detailed in Section 3.5) we used the tool trec eval. This tool compares the list of retrieved documents (obtained from Zettair) against the list of relevant documents (provided by CLEF). Multiword Expression as Single Terms In this work, we focused on MWEs composed of exactly two words (i.e. bigrams). In order to incorporate MWEs as units for the IR system to index, we adopted a very simple heuristics that concatenated together all terms composing an MWE using \" \" (e.g. letter bomb as letter bomb). Figure 2 exemplifies this concatenation. Each bigram present in a predefined dictionary and occurring in a document is treated as a single term, for indexing and retrieval purposes. The rationale was that documents containing specific MWEs can be indexed more adequately than those containing the words of the expression separately. As a result, retrieval quality should increase. <TERM ID=\"GH950102-000000-126\" LEMA=\"underworld\" POS=\"NN\"> <WF>underworld</WF> <SYNSET SCORE=\"0.5\" CODE=\"06120171-n\"/> <SYNSET SCORE=\"0.5\" CODE=\"06327598-n\"/> </TERM> Original Topic: -What was the role of the Hubble telescope in proving the existence of black holes?

The dictionaries containing the MWEs to be inserted into the corpus as a single term, are created by a number of techniques involving automatic and manual extraction. Below we describe how these MWE dictionaries were created. \u2022 Compound Nouns (CN) -for the creation of this dictionary, we extracted all bigrams contained in the corpus. Since the number of available bigrams was very large (99,744,811 bigrams) we filtered them using the information in the original documents, the morphosyntactic tags. Along with the LEMA field, extracted in the previous procedure, we also extracted the value of the field POS (part-of-speech). In order to make the experiment feasible, we used only bigrams formed by compound nouns, in other words, when the POS of both words was NN (Noun). Thus, with bigrams consisting of sequences of NN as a preprocessing step to eliminate noise that could affect the experiment, the number of bigrams with MWE candidates was reduced to 308,871. The next step was the selection of bigrams that had the highest frequency in the text, so we chose candidates occurring at least ten times in the whole corpus. As a result, the first list of MWEs was composed by 15,001 bigrams, called D1. \u2022 Best Compound Nouns -after D1, we refined the list with the use of statistical methods. The methods used were the mutual information and chi-square. It was necessary to obtain frequency values from Web using the search tool Yahoo!, because despite the number of terms in the corpus, it was possible that the newspa-per genre of our corpus would bias the counts. For this work we used the number of pages in which a term occurs as a measure of frequency. With the association measures based on web frequencies, we generated a ranking in decreasing order of score for each entry. We merged the rankings by calculating the average rank between the positions of each MWE; the first 7,500 entries composed the second dictionary, called D2. \u2022 Worst Compound Nouns -this dictionary was created from bigrams that have between five and nine occurrences and are more likely to cooccur by chance. It was created in order to evaluate whether the choice of the potentially more noisy MWEs entailed a negative effect in the results of IR, compared to the previous dictionaries. The third dictionary, with 17,328 bigrams, is called D3. \u2022 Gold Standard -this was created from a sublist of the Cambridge International Dictionary of English (Procter, 1995) , containing MWEs. Since this list contains all types of MWEs, it was necessary to further filter these to obtain compound nouns only, using morphosyntactic information obtained by the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) , which for English is reported to have an accuracy of 96.36%\" (Schmid, 1994) . Formed by 568 MWEs, the fourth dictionary will be called D4. \u2022 Manual -for comparative purposes, we also created two dictionaries by manually evaluating the text of the 310 query topics. The first dictionary contained all bigrams which would achieve a different meaning if the words were concatenated (e.g. space shuttle). This dictionary, was called D6 and contains 254 expressions. The other one was created by a specialist (linguist) who classified as true or false a list of MWE candidates from the query topics. The linguist selection of MWEs formed D7 with 178 bigrams. Creating Indices For the experiments, we needed to manipulate the corpus in different ways, using previously built dictionaries. The MWEs from dictionaries have been inserted in the corpus as single terms, as described before. For each dictionary, an index was created in the IR system. These indices are described below: 1. Baseline (BL) -corpus without MWE. 2. Compound Nouns (CN) -with 15 MWEs of D1. 3. Best CN (BCN) -with 7,500 MWEs of D2. 4. Worst CN (WCN) -with 17,328 MWEs of D3. Gold Standard (GS) -with 568 MWEs of D4. 6. Decision Tree (DT) -with 12,782 MWEs of D5. 7. Manual 1 (M1) -with 254 MWEs of D6. 8. Manual 2 (M2) -with 178 MWEs of D7. Evaluation Metrics To evaluate the results of the IR system, we need to use metrics that estimate how well a user's query was satisfied by the system. IR evaluation is based on recall and precision. Precision (Eq. 1) is the portion of the retrieved documents which is actually relevant to the query. Recall (Eq. 2) is the fraction of the relevant documents which is retrieved by the IRS. P recision(P ) = #Relevant #Retrieved #Retrieved (1) Recall(R) = #Relevant #Retrieved #Relevant (2) Precision and Recall are set-based measures, therefore, they do not take into consideration the ordering in which the relevant items were retrieved. In order to evaluate ranked retrieval results the most widely used measurement is the average precision (AvP ). AvP emphasizes returning more relevant documents earlier in the ranking. For a set of queries, we calculate the Mean Average Precision (MAP) according to Equation 3 (Manning et al., 2008) . M AP (Q) = 1 |Q| |Q| j=1 1 m j m j k=1 P (R jk ) (3) where |Q| is the number of queries, R jk is the set of ranked retrieval results from the top result until document d k , and m j is the number of relevant documents for query j. Experiment and Evaluations The experiments performed evaluate the insertion of MWEs in results obtained in the IR system. The analysis is divided into two evaluations: (A) total set of query topics, where an overview is given of the MWE insertion effects and (B) topics modified by MWEs, where we evaluate only the query topics that contain MWEs. Evaluation A This evaluation investigates the effects of inserting MWEs in documents and queries. After each type of index was generated, MWEs were also included in the query topics, in accordance to the dictionaries used for each index (for Baseline BL, the query topics had no modifications). With eight corpus variations, we obtained individual results for each one of them. The results presented in Table 2 It is possible to see a small improvement in the results for the indices M1 and M2 in relation to the baseline (BL). This happens because the choice of candidate MWEs was made from the contents of the document topics and not, as with other indices, from the whole corpus. Considering the indices built with MWEs extracted from the corpus, the best result is index GS.In second place, comes the CN index, with a subtle improvement over the Baseline. BL surprisingly got a better result than the Best and Worst CN. The loss in retrieval quality as a result from MWE identification for BCN was not expected. When comparing the gain or loss in MAP of individual query topics, we can see how the index BCN compares to the Baseline: BCN had better MAP in 149 and worse MAP in 108 cases. However, the average loss is higher than the average gain, this explains why BL obtains a better result overall. In order do decide if one run is indeed superior to another, instead of using the absolute MAP value, we chose to calculate a margin of 5%. The intuition behind this is that in IR, a difference of less than 5% between the results being compared is not considered significant (Buckley and Voorhees, 2000) . To be considered as gain the difference between the values resulting from two different indices for the same query topic should be greater than 5%. Differences of less than 5% are considered ties. This way, MAP values of 0.1111 and 0.1122 are considered ties. Given this margin, we can see in Tables 3 and  4 that the indices BCN and WCN are better compared to the baseline. In the case of BCN, the gain is almost 20% of cases and the WCN, the difference between gain and loss is less than 2%.   Finally, this first experiment guided us toward a deeper evaluation of the query topics that have MWEs, because there is a possibility that the MWE insertions in documents can decrease the accuracy of the system on topics that have no MWE. Evaluation B This evaluation studies in detail the effects on the document retrieval in response to topics in which there were MWEs. For this purpose, we used the same indices used before and we performed an individual evaluation of the topics, to obtain a better understanding on where the identification of MWEs improves or degrades the results. As each dictionary was created using a different methodology, the number of expressions contained in each dictionary is also different. Thus, for each method, the number of query topics considered as having MWEs varies according to the dictionary used. Table 5 shows the number of query topics containing MWEs for each dictionary used, and as a consequence, the percentage of modified query topics over the complete set of 310 topics. First, it is interesting to observe the values of MAP for all topics that have been altered by the identification of MWEs. These values are shown in Table 6 . As shown in 3 ), the best the result among all the indices was obtained by the CN. <TERM ID=\"GH950102-000000-126\" LEMA=\"underworld\" POS=\"NN\"> <WF>underworld</WF> <SYNSET SCORE=\"0.5\" CODE=\"06120171-n\"/> <SYNSET SCORE=\"0.5\" CODE=\"06327598-n\"/> </TERM> Original Topic: -What was the role of the Hubble telescope in proving the existence of black holes?

The relevant document (in bold) is the fourth position in the Baseline. After inserting the expression letter bomb twice (because it occurs twice in the original topic), and tv channel that were in dictionary D1 used by the CN index, the relevant document is scored higher and as a consequence is returned in the first position of the ranking(Table 8 ) . The MAP of this topic has increased 75 percentage points, from 0.2500 in Baseline to 1.000 in the CN index. We see also that the document that was in first position in the Baseline ranking, has its score decreased and was ranked in fourth position in the ranking given by the CN. This document contained information on a \"small bomb located outside the of the Russian embassy\" and has is not relevant to topic 141, being properly relegated to a lower position. An interesting fact about this topic is that only the MWE letter bomb influences the result. This was verified as in the index BCN, whose dictionary does not have this MWE, the topic was changed only because of the MWE tv channel and there was no gain or loss for the result. The second highest gain was of M1 index, in topic 173. The gain was of 28 percentage points. On the other hand, we found a downside in M1 and M2 indices, although they improved results on average, they have reached very high values of loss in some topics. In sum, the MWEs insertion seems to improve retrieval bringing more relevant documents, due to a more precise indexing of specific terms. However, the use of these expressions also brought a negative impact for some cases, because some topics require a semantic analysis to return relevant documents (as for example topic 130, which requires relevant documents to mention the causes of the death of Kurt Cobain -documents which mention his death without mentioning the causes were not considered relevant). Conclusions and Future Work This work consists in investigating the impact of Multiword Expressions on applications, focusing on compound nouns in Information Retrieval systems, and whether a more adequate treatment for these expressions can bring possible improvements in the indexing these expressions. MWEs are found in all genres of texts and their appropriate use is being targeted for study, both in linguistics and computing, due to the different characteristic variations of this type of expression, which ends up causing problems for the success of computational methods that aim their processing. In this work we aimed at achieving a better understanding of several important points associated with the use of Multiword Expressions in IR systems. In general, the MWEs insertion improves the results of retrieval for relevant documents, because the indexing of specific terms makes it easier to retrieve specific documents related to these terms. Nevertheless, the use of these expressions made the results worse in some c]ases, because some topics require a semantic analysis to return relevant documents. Some of these documents are related to the query, but do not satisfy all criteria in the query topic. We conclude also that the quality of MWEs used directly influenced the results. For future work, we would like to use other MWE types and not just compound nouns as used in this work. Other methods of extraction and a further study in Named Entities are good themes to complement this subject. A variation of corpora, different from newspaper articles, because each domain has a specific terminology, can also be an interesting subject for further evaluation.",
