    "article": "Song lyrics can be considered as a text genre that has features of both written and spoken discourse, and potentially provides extensive linguistic and cultural information to scientists from various disciplines. However, pop songs play a rather subordinate role in empirical language research so far -most likely due to the absence of scientifically valid and sustainable resources. The present paper introduces a multiply annotated corpus of German lyrics as a publicly available basis for multidisciplinary research. The resource contains three types of data for the investigation and evaluation of quite distinct phenomena: TEI-compliant song lyrics as primary data, linguistically and literary motivated annotations, and extralinguistic metadata. It promotes empirically/statistically grounded analyses of genre-specific features, systemic-structural correlations and tendencies in the texts of contemporary pop music. The corpus has been stratified into thematic and author-specific archives; the paper presents some basic descriptive statistics, as well as the public online frontend with its built-in evaluation forms and live visualisations. Introduction Systematically compiled collections of written texts and speech form the most important empirical basis for linguistically motivated research on human language. Extensive data resources exist for standard and close-tostandard language varieties, supplemented by special corpora covering specific language situations and fields of application (Kupietz/Schmidt 2018 , Lemnitzer/Zinsmeister 2015 , L\u00fcdeling/Kyt\u00f6 2008 , McEnery/Hardie 2012) . Noteworthy against this background is the lack of scientifically valid, sustainably utilizable digital collections of pop lyrics, especially for the German language. Just as pop music has evolved from an originally youth cultural phenomenon in the nineteen-fifties and -sixties into an integral part of modern culture, its textual content has become omnipresent in the realm of everyday language. We are surrounded by pop lyrics, e.g. in the form of in-car radio listening, online streaming services, ambient music for department stores and restaurants, or in the context of television shows. Added to this is a somewhat lyrical claim: song texts can be categorized as \"poetry of use\"the German term \"Gebrauchslyrik\" was introduced 1927 by Bertold Brecht and applied to song texts by Bl\u00fchdorn (2003) . They are \"latently poetic, but rarely authentically poetic\" (Flender/Rough 1989) . Quite frequently, lyrics are not just consumed for the sake of distraction, but intended as a means of conveying messages and feelings, oron the recipient sideas a medium to find inspiration and explanations at some point in life. In view of this considerably high \"communicative impact factor\" (Kreyer/Mukherjee 2007) , there is a substantial desideratum regarding the consideration of pop lyrics as a separate genre in corpus linguistics. Though it is true that literary studies have discovered lyrics as a promising subject of investigation, none of the well-established large corpus collections contains lyrics. Correspondingly little studied are empirical aspects such as aesthetics and style (vocabulary, syntax, register, etc.) , content (topics, e.g. in the historical and/or political context), emotion and sentiment (categorization, intensity, and distribution), or relationships between form and content. As it is customary for less-researched language varieties, initial testing and validation of statistical measures and NLP methods seem desirable. Here, too, the introduced song corpus can be seen as an important step to fill an existing gap. Related Work Despite some promising approaches towards the exploration of language characteristics for selected artists (see, e.g., von Ammon/von Petersdorff 2019), empirically grounded research on German pop lyrics on a broad base remains comparatively scarce, not least due to the nonexistence of publicly available, reasonably stratified and preprocessed corpora. For the English language, however, there are inspiring examples of corpus-linguistic findings on discourse and language phenomena in lyrics. Werner (2019) contrasts a custom-built corpus of lyrics by US-American rap artists (LYRAP) to a corpus of pop lyrics (LYPOP), exploring the linguistic side of hip-hop discourse. Brett/Pinna (2018) present the Sassari Lyrics (SLY) corpus with 10 million tokens, covering various subgenres. The BLUR corpus (Miethaner 2005 ) gathers more than 8,000 digitized American blues songs. Another milestone is provided by Kreyer/Mukherjee (2007) with the Gie\u00dfen-Bonn Corpus of Popular Music (GBoP), which makes texts of Top 30 albums empirically evaluable; Kreyer (2012) uses this resource in order to check some well-known stereotypes and clich\u00e9s for truth. Eiter (2017) examines lyrics as a specific genre between spoken and written language, and compares a custom-built 120,000 token song corpus to the balanced COCA (Davies 2015) and BNC (British National Corpus 2007) resources. Katznelson et al. (2010) and Cullen (2009) describe corpus studies of rock, pop, and country lyrics; Watanabe (2018) establishes the American Popular Music Corpus of English (PMCE-US). Bertin-Mahieux et al. (2011) have built a socalled \"Million Song Dataset\", while Murphey (1992) compiles an early collection of Top 50 chart songs, which is then evaluated quantitatively (eg., regarding type-token ratio) and qualitatively (eg., regarding the use of pronouns). Other English-language collections exist for specific genre subdomains, such as the Rock Lyrics Corpus (ROLC; Falk 2013), or a corpus of Billboard 100 songs (Nishina 2017) . Regarding linguistic feature richness, Werner (2012) compares American and British English in pop songs, and outlines its didactic potential (Werner 2018) . Werner/Lehl (2015) discuss practical aspects of the appropriateness of lyrics for second language learning, refining some suggestions of Plitsch (1997) , who raises the idea of using contemporary lyrics for a more motivating and close-toreality language teaching. Tegge (2017) checks the lexical coverage of pop lyrics in English language teaching, using two collections of around 1,000 pop songs. Coats (2016) mentions the unique and authentic role of music for the acquisition of lexical fluency, while Terhune (1997) takes a critical look at the undeniable fact that lyrics generally do not conform to close-to-standard syntactic rules. Squires (2018) presents experiments on the influence of nonstandard grammatical forms in pop lyrics on native speakers. Viol (2000) discusses identity-building aspects of British pop lyrics, Motschenbacher (2016) and Van Hoey (2016) compare English Eurovision Song Contest lyrics with more general corpora. Connor (2018) presents rhythmic transcriptions for rap songs, while Olivo (2001) examines rap spelling conventions. In addition to these broadly set up contributions, there exist stylistic analyzes of songwriters, eg. Johnson/Larson (2003) on the use of metaphors in Beatles' lyrics, or Morini (2013) discussing linguistic peculiarities in the lyrics of Kate Bush. Pop lyrics are sometimes regarded as a reflection of political, economic, or social phenomena (Shukers 1998); Bl\u00fchdorn (2003) illustrates this through the example of German songwriters Udo Lindenberg and Konstantin Wecker. Both Machin (2010) and Kreyer (2015) evaluate lyrics against the background of discussions about sexuality and gender-appropriate language. Napier/Shamir (2018) take a diachronic perspective and quantify emotional changes in lyrics since 1950. The results show a long-term significant increase of anger, rage and grief (with a brief decline in the mid-eighties). The expression of anxiety continues to increase until the 1980s, albeit with a lower growing rate. The expression of joy in song lyrics remains significantly decreasing over the entire period. Also for the English language, applications of computational linguistics can be found, such as methods and tools for Text Mining, Sentiment Analysis and Topic modeling. Mahedero et al. (2005) evaluate the suitability of Natural Language Processing tools for the evaluation of pop music texts; Liske (2018) describes the use of the statistics software R for the analysis of lyrics written by artist Prince. Penaranda (2006) uses text mining for empirically based genre assignments, involving linguistic anomalies. Behl/Choudhury (2011) conduct in-depth complex network analyses in order to model specific features (vocabulary limitations, syntactical restrictions, creative word usage, etc.) of Bollywood song lyrics. Corpus Building Validating quantitative language regularities, e.g. distribution laws such as the Zipf-Mandelbrot lawcovering the relationship between frequency rank and frequency of linguistic units -, functional laws such as the Menzerath-Altmann lawdealing with correlations between the length of a linguistic construct and the length of its immediate componentsor logistic models like the Piotrowski law for determining the dispersion of new words from a diachronic perspective (see K\u00f6hler 2005 , Biemann 2007 , Schneider 2019) , require strict physical integrity of all objects of study. The explanatory power of quantitive regularities only unfolds in the analysis of complete texts, because the measured variables (strophe, verse line, word etc.) are always results of individual text generation processes (Sinclair 2005) . Stratification objective is therefore the comprehensive coverage of complete works, and not just the arbitrary compilation of some lyrics' verses or phrases. As of spring 2020, two corpus archives represent the works of singers/songwriters Udo Lindenberg and Konstantin Wecker, spanning a period of five decades. A third archive (see Pop lyrics, as well as the vast majority of digital resources in linguistics, are typically subject to third parties' rights. Therefore, in order to protect intellectual property, it is necessary to conclude licensing agreements. For artists who have kindly agreed to provide their lyrics for noncommercial, scientific research, the corresponding annotated archives are available in TEI-compliant XML format, and can be downloaded for further exploration. The charts archive, in contrast, is available in a bag-of-words format only, where tab-separated columns contain the number of occurences for a token or lemma per year, and can be used for further processing with statistical tools. In order to cover various levels of granularity and to ensure interoperability, all lyrics are formatted using structural descriptions according to TEI P5 (TEI Consortium 2019). E.g., the element types <lg> (linegroup) and <l> (line) mark strophes and verse lines; performance directives are annotated with <stage> elements, header element types like <titleStmt>, <publicationStmt>, and <sourceDesc> contain metadata concerning the source or publication of songs. The initial sentence and word segmentation has to deal with the challenging fact that lyrics primarily have to function acoustically. The written textual form often does not contain punctuation marks, or at least does not use them consistently for the identification of phrases or sentences. As a consequence, fully-automatic detection and annotation of such units produces rather poor results, and must be supported by manual pre-processing. Applying again TEI-standardsnamely the element types <add> and <del> -, the original lyrics are transferred into close-to-standard representations, enabling further processing with NLP tools, but also retranslation at all times. The song bodies are then submitted to the CLARIN infrastructure component WebLicht (Hinrichs et al. 2010) . A customized tool chain is worked through, including the IMS tokenizer, TreeTagger with STTS part of speech tagset (Schiller 1999 ), a named entity recognizer trained on TuebaDZ, and the Berkeley constituent parser. The immediate results confirm the assumption that application of standard-language-oriented categories and procedures to less homogenous language varieties requires specific adaptations (Horbach et Overall, lyrics often show a conscious play on norms on a variety of linguistic levels (syntactic structure, spelling, semantics, part of speech, word formation, etc.). In order to assure consistent description quality, all annotation steps need to be reviewed, so the corpus processing takes place as an interplay between automated annotation runs and manual post-editing. For this purpose, WebLicht results are imported into the web-based curation platform WebAnno (Eckart de Castilho et al. 2016) . This allows the application of an extended POS tagset (based on Bartz et al. 2014 , Bei\u00dfwenger et al. 2015 , Westpfahl et al. 2017) . Its enhanced inventory includes appropriate POS tags for the newly discovered contracted forms mentioned above. During post-processing, new classes for named entitites are introduced, based on (Benikova et al. 2014) Furthermore, a special layer for neologisms and occasionalisms offers the opportunity for handling innovative language and puns. The corresponding tagset comprises \"new word\" (e.g. vorherragend instead of hervorragend, engl. outstanding), \"new meaning\" (e.g. Oberindianer, addressing not the chief of an indian tribe, but the former GDR head of state), \"word combination\" (even multilingual, e.g. howauchever as a parody of engl. howsoever, integrating German auch), and \"intentional misspelling\" (e.g. Lusthansa instead of Lufthansa). Finally, an annotation layer for linking of rhyming words is added (\"initial rhyme\", \"internal rhyme\", \"end rhyme\"). All annotationsmultiple classes, multiple annotatorsare subject to inter-annotator reliability, using Fleiss' kappa. Data Exploration The curated annotation layers are exported using the WebAnno TSV export format, which is similar to CoNNL file formats, but adds specialized layer information to the header and column representations. Together with the TEIcompliant XML instances, they are stored within an objectrelational database system, providing fast and powerful retrieval options. A dedicated website (songkorpus.de) offers combined search by various attributes like token, lemma, and POS, as well as the exploration of aggregated statistics and live visualizations. Lyrics can be considered as a text genre that has features of both written and spoken discourse. Particularly for applied disciplines such as stylometry, the vocabulary richness (Yule 1944 ) respectively lexical diversity (Carroll 1938) open up an interesting field of investigation. The idea starts from the assumption that measured values like type token ratio are indicators for the individual vocabulary size of an author (Tanaka-Ishii/Aihara 2015). One methodological problem remains the fact that, as a consequence of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law (Mandelbrot 1953) , almost all measures (like TTR, STTR) vary depending on corpus size (Tweedie and Baayen 1998, Evert et al. 2017 ). To approach these issues, the corpus portal (Songkorpus 2020) offers a range of useful metadata, parameters, and statistical graphs.   Lyrics can be used to calculate the most important keywords for certain artists, time periods, or albums (see figure 2 ), using weighting schemes like TF-IDF (Manning et al. 2008, 118) . Evaluating the neologism annotation layer, innovative word formations may be identified.  To give one last example: As a special application of named entity recognition, the online corpus explorer offers geovisualization of identified place names that arise in the lyrics. Using their geographical coordinates from a database lookup table, LOC entities are displayed on a map. This allows a quick overview of countries, cities, and even buildings or monuments that are subject of song texts. Figure 3 shows the distribution within Europe, allowing a traceback from locations to corresponding lyrics or artists. Conclusion and Outlook The multi-layer annotated \u00abSongkorpus\u00bb provides a number of potentially valuable primary and meta data for empirical research on contemporary German pop lyrics. It thus fills a public data gap in the continuum between both standard and nonstandard, written and spoken language, that previously prevented comprehensive and statistically founded answers to syntactic, semantic or pragmatic questions for this genre. The multidisciplinary links appear exceedingly promising: besides linguistics and literature, benefiting research areas can be located in the broad spectrum of language didactics, (socio)cultural studies, musicology, or media studies. The machine-readable corpus data can be explored online, or downloaded for further statistical processing. Unlike existing free lyrics sites that remain a legal grey area, \u00abSongkorpus\u00bb offers a consistent, sustainable, legally sound solution for academic research. The processing pipeline involves automatic taggingthat will increasingly use specially trained NLP tools, as data is accumulatedand manual verification steps. Further plans are to extend the chronological and sub-genre span by adding more collected works of individual artists, and cross-sectional archives. In view of the largely textbased nature of already included singer/songwriter compositions, it would be a worthwhile option to compare its linguistic characteristics and thematic tendencies with, for instance, German hip-hop discourse.",
