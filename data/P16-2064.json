    "article": "Classification of temporal textual data sequences is a common task in various domains such as social media and the Web. In this paper we propose to use Hawkes Processes for classifying sequences of temporal textual data, which exploit both temporal and textual information. Our experiments on rumour stance classification on four Twitter datasets show the importance of using the temporal information of tweets along with the textual content. Introduction Sequence classification tasks are often associated with temporal information, where the timestamp is available for each of the data instances. For instance, in sentiment classification of reviews in forums, opinions of users are associated with a timestamp, indicating the time at which they were posted. Similarly, in an event detection task in Twitter, tweets being posted on a continuous basis need to be analysed and classified in order to detect the occurrence of some event. Nevertheless, traditional sequence classification approaches (Song et al., 2014; Gorrell and Bontcheva, 2016) ignore the time information in these textual data sequences. In this paper, we aim to consider the continuous time information along with the textual information for classifying sequences of temporal textual data. In particular, we consider the problem of rumour stance classification in Twitter, where tweets provide temporal information associated with the textual tweet content. Rumours spread rapidly through social media, creating widespread chaos, increasing anxiety in society and in some cases even leading to riots. For instance, during an earthquake in Chile in 2010, rumours circulating on Twitter stated that a volcano had become active and there was a tsunami warning, which were later proven false. Denials and corrections of these viral pieces of information might often come late and without the sufficient effect to prevent the harm that the rumours can produce (Lewandowsky et al., 2012) . This posits the importance of carefully analysing tweets associated with rumours and the stance expressed in them to prevent the spread of malicious rumours. Determining the stance of rumour tweets can in turn be effectively used for early detection of the spread of rumours, as well as for flagging rumours as being potentially false when a large number of people are found to be countering them. The rumour stance classification task has been previously defined as that in which a classifier needs to determine whether each of the tweets is supporting, denying or questioning a rumour (Qazvinian et al., 2011) . Here we add a fourth label, commenting, which is assigned to tweets that do not add anything to the veracity of a rumour. In this paper, we propose to use Hawkes Processes (Hawkes, 1971) , commonly used for modelling information diffusion in social media (Yang and Zha, 2013; De et al., 2015) , for the task of rumour stance classification. Hawkes Processes (HP) are a self-exciting temporal point process ideal for modelling the occurrence of tweets in Twitter (Zhao et al., 2015) . The model assumes that the occurrence of a tweet will influence the rate at which future tweets will arrive. Figure 1 shows the behaviour of the intensity functions associated with a multivariate Hawkes Process. Note the intensity spikes at the points of tweet occurrences. In applications such as stance classification, different labels can influence one another. This can be modelled effectively using the mutually exciting behaviour of Hawkes Processes. In the end, we demonstrate how the information gar- nered from rumour dynamics can be beneficial to stance classification of tweets around rumours. Little work has been done on stance classification of rumour tweets. Qazvinian et al. (2011) introduced a system for classifying rumour tweets and Lukasik et al. (2015a) considered this problem in a setting where the tweets associated with a new emerging rumour is the target for classification. Both works ignored the temporal information. On the other hand, research has been done on modeling dynamics of rumour propagation (Lukasik et al., 2015b) . Here, we show how using information about dynamics of rumour propagation is important to the problem of rumour stance classification. The novel contributions of this paper are: 1. Developing a Hawkes Process model for time sensitive sequence classification. 2. Demonstrating on real world data how temporal dynamics conveys important information for stance classification. 3. Establishing the new state of the art method for rumour stance classification. 4. Broadening the set of labels considered in previous work to include a new label commenting. Software used for experiments can be found at https://github.com/mlukasik/ seqhawkes. Problem definition We consider a collection D of rumours, D = {R 1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , R |D| }. Each rumour R i contains a set of tweets discussing it, R i = {d 1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , d n i }. Each tweet is represented as a tuple d j = (t j , W j , m j , y j ), which includes the following information: t j is the posting time of the tweet, W j is the text message, m j is the rumour category and y j is the label, y j \u2208 Y = {supporting, denying, questioning, commenting}. We define the stance classification task as that in which each tweet d j needs to be classified into one of the four categories, y j \u2208 Y , which represents the stance of the tweet d j with respect to the rumour R i it belongs to. We consider the Leave One Out (LOO) setting, introduced by Lukasik et al. (2015a) , where for each rumour R i \u2208 D we construct the test set equal to R i and the training set equal to D \\ R i . The final performance scores we report in the paper are averaged across all rumours. This represents a realistic scenario where a classifier has to deal with a new, unseen rumour. Data We consider four Twitter rumour datasets with tweets annotated for stance (Zubiaga et al., 2016) . 1  The authors relied on a slightly different scheme for the annotation, given that they annotated treestructured conversation threads where a source tweet initiates a rumour and a number of replies follow responding to it. Given this structure, the source tweet of a Twitter conversation is annotated as supporting, denying or underspecified, and each subsequent tweet is annotated as agreed, disagreed, appeal for more information (questioning) or commenting with respect to the source tweet. We convert these labels into our set of four including supporting, denying, questioning and commenting, which extends the set of three labels used before in the literature (Qazvinian et al., 2011; Lukasik et al., 2015a) adding the new label commenting. To perform this conversion, we first remove rumours where the source tweet is annotated as underspecified, keeping the rest of source tweets as supporting or denying. For the subsequent tweets, we keep their label as is for the tweets that are questioning or commenting. To convert those tweets that agree or disagree into supporting or denying, we apply the following set of rules: (1) if a tweet agrees to a supporting source tweet, we label it supporting, (2) if a tweet agrees to a denying source tweet, we label it denying, (3) if a tweet disagrees to a supporting source tweet, we label it denying and (4) if a tweet disagrees to a denying tweet, we label it supporting. The latter enables to infer stance with respect to the rumour from the original annotations that instead refer to agreement with respect to the source. Figure 2 shows examples of tweets taken from the dataset along with our inferred annotations. We summarise the statistics of the resulting dataset in Table 1 . Note that the commenting label accounts for the majority of the tweets. Model Hawkes Processes are a probabilistic framework for modelling self-exciting phenomena, which has been used for modelling memes and their spread across social networks (Yang and Zha, 2013). They have been used to model the generation of tweets over a continuous time domain (Zhao et al., 2015) . The frequency of tweets generated by them is determined by an underlying intensity function which considers the influence from past tweets. The intensity function models the self-exciting nature by adding up the influence from past tweets. We use a multi-variate Hawkes process for modelling the mutually exciting phenomena between the tweet labels. In this section we describe how we apply the Hawkes Process framework for rumour stance classification. Intensity Function In the intensity function formulation, we assume that all previous tweets associated with a rumour influence the occurrence of a new tweet. This allows to use information on all the other tweets that have been posted about a rumour. We consider the intensity function to be summation of base intensity and the intensities associated with all the previous tweets, \u03bb y,m (t)=\u00b5 y + t <t I(m = m)\u03b1 y ,y \u03ba(t \u2212 t ), (1) where the first term represents the constant base intensity of generating label y. The second term represents the influence from the tweets that happen prior to time of interest. The influence from each tweet decays over time and is modelled using an exponential decay term \u03ba(t \u2212 t ) = \u03c9 exp(\u2212\u03c9(t \u2212 t )). The matrix \u03b1 of size |Y | \u00d7 |Y | encodes the degrees of influence between pairs of labels assigned to the tweets, e.g. a questioning label may influence the occurrence of a rejecting label in future tweets differently from how it would influence a commenting label. Likelihood function The parameters governing the intensity function are learnt by maximizing the likelihood of generating the tweets. The complete likelihood function is given by L(t, y, m, W ) = (2) N n=1 p(W n |y n )\u00d7 N n=1 \u03bb yn,mn (t n ) \u00d7p(E T ), where the first term provides the likelihood of generating text given the label and is modelled as a multinomial distribution conditioned on the label, p(W n |y n ) = V v=1 \u03b2 Wnv ynv , (3) where V is the vocabulary size and \u03b2 is the matrix of size |Y | \u00d7 V specifying the language model for each label. The second term provides the likelihood of occurrence of tweets at times t 1 , . . . , t n and the third term provides the likelihood that no tweets happen in the interval [0, T ] except at times t 1 , . . . , t n . We estimate the parameters of the model by maximizing the log-likelihood, l(t, y, m, W ) = \u2212 |Y | y=1 |D| m=1 T 0 \u03bb y,m (s)ds+ N n=1 log \u03bb yn,mn (t n ) + N n=1 V v=1 W nv log \u03b2 ynv . (4) The integral term in Equation ( 4 ) is easily computed for the intensity function since the exponential decay function and the constant function are easily integrable.

In one approach to \u00b5 and \u03b1 optimization (HP Approx.) we approximate the log term in Equation ( 4 ) by taking the log inside the summation terms in Equation ( 1 ). This approximation leads to closed form updates for \u00b5 and \u03b1, \u00b5 y = N n=1 I(y n = y) T |D| , \u03b1 ij = N n=1 n l=1 I(m l = m n )I(y l = i)I(y n =j) N k=1 I(y k = i)K(T \u2212 t k ) , where K(T \u2212 t k ) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c9(T \u2212 t k )) arises from the integration of \u03ba(t \u2212 t k ). In a different approach (HP Grad.) we find parameters using joint gradient based optimization over \u00b5 and \u03b1, using derivatives of log-likelihood dl d\u00b5 and dl d\u03b1 . In optimization, we operate in the logspace of the parameters in order to ensure positivity, and employ L-BFGS approach to gradient search. Moreover, we initialize parameters with those found by the HP Approx. method. Similar to Yang and Zha (2013), we fix the decay parameter \u03c9, in our case to 0.1. Prediction We predict the most likely label for each test tweet as the label which maximises the likelihood of occurrence of the tweet from Equation (2), or the approximated likelihood in case of HP Approx. The likelihood considers both the textual information and the temporal dynamics in predicting the label for the tweet. The predicted labels are then considered while predicting the labels for next tweets in the test data. Thus, we follow a greedy sequence classification approach. Experiments We conduct experiments using the rumour datasets described in Table 1 . We consider our Hawkes Process model described in Section 4 as well as a set of baseline and benchmark approaches. Baselines We compare our model against baselines: Language Model considers only the textual information through multinomial distribution defined in Equation (3). Majority vote classifier based on the training label distribution. Naive Bayes models the text using a multinomial likelihood and a prior over label frequencies (Manning et al., 2008) . Note that Multinomial, Majority vote and Naive Bayes approaches are special cases of our Hawkes Process model for classification, where a particular subset of parameters is fixed to 0. Benchmark models We compare our model against the following competitive benchmark models: SVM Support Vector Machines with the cost coefficient selected via nested cross-validation. GP Gaussian Processes have been shown by Lukasik et al. (2015a) to work well, particularly in supervised settings where a multitask learning kernel has been used to learn correlations across different rumours. Here we use a single task kernel (linear) as we consider the fully unsupervised setting. CRF Conditional Random Field (Lafferty et al., 2001) ters are chosen using cross-validation. Results The results are shown in Table 2 . We report accuracy (Acc) and macro average of F 1 scores across all labels (F 1 ). Each metric is calculated over combined sequences of labels from all rumours, thus conducting a micro average over rumours. We can observe that in terms of accuracy, HP Approx. beats all other methods. Notice that Language model is the worst model for this metric. On the other hand, in terms of F 1 score, Language model and GP become the best methods, with HP Approx. method not performing as well anymore. Overall, different metrics yield very different rankings of methods. Nevertheless, we can notice that HP Grad. outperforms NB under all metrics on all datasets. This is the case also for GP baseline, which turns out to be very competitive according to F 1 score. As we mentioned before, HP can be viewed as a NB classifier with a time-dependent prior. This shows, that the temporal dynamics based prior provided by HP is more helpful than the simple frequency based prior from NB according to all considered metrics. In Figure 1 we show an illustration of the intensity function of the HP Grad. model for rumour #1 from the Ferguson dataset. Notice the self-exciting property, with spikes in the intensity functions for different labels at times when tweets occur. Moreover, spikes occur even when a tweet from a different label is posted, for example around 1 hour and 50 minutes into the rumour lifespan a questioning tweet is posted which causes a spike in intensity for commenting tweets. Another issue is the approximation used in HP Approx. which might lead to violation of the Hawkes Process mutual-excitation property. In particular, we noticed that in some scenarios occurrences of tweets cause decrease in the intensity value rather than spikes. However, the accuracy metric which has been used in previous work for this task (Lukasik et al., 2015a) yielded by this method turns out to be the best, although when measuring F 1 the relative ordering changes with the GP performing best (Lukasik et al., 2015a) closely followed by other techniques including HP Grad. which is competitive on all datasets. Conclusions We proposed a novel model based on Hawkes Processes for sequence classification of stances in Twitter which takes into account temporal information in addition to text. Using four Twitter datasets and experimenting on rumour stance classification of tweets, we have shown that HP is a competitive approach, which outperforms a range of strong benchmark methods by providing the multinomial language model with an informative prior based on temporal dynamics. Our experiments posit the importance of making use of temporal information available in tweets, which along with the textual content provide valuable information for the model to perform well on the task.
