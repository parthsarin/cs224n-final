One role type consists of numbered semantic roles, like in PropBank, to capture relations between arguments in different syntactic patterns. The other role type consists of semantic roles with conventional names. Both role types are compatible with hierarchical frames that belong to related predicates. Adding semantic role and frame information to the NPCMJ will support a web environment where language learners and linguists can search examples of Japanese for syntactic and semantic features. The annotation will also provide a language resource for NLP researchers making semantic parsing models (e.g., for AMR parsing) following machine learning approaches. In this paper, we describe how the two types of semantic role labels are defined under the frame based approach, i.e., both types can be consistently applied when linked to corresponding frames. Then we show special cases of syntactic patterns and the current status of the annotation work. Introduction Semantic role labeled data is important to capture predicate-argument sentence level meaning for NLP researchers, linguists, and language learners. For English, various kinds of annotated corpora with semantic roles and frames are provided (e.g., PropBank (Bonial et al., 2010) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) ) and they are widely used. The numbered semantic roles (e.g., Arg0, Arg1, Arg2) proposed in PropBank are effective for adapting to various systems of semantic roles. Thus, the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013) approach, which is based on PropBank numbered semantic roles and frames, has attracted a lot of attention from NLP researchers as a model for describing sentence-level semantics. AMR parsing models are studied with deep neural network models, e.g., (Zhang et al., 2019) using AMR resources for English 1 . In terms of Japanese language resources, several corpora containing annotated tags related to predicateargument information have been proposed (Kyoto (Kawahara et al., 2002) , NAIST (Iida et al., 2007) , EDR (EDR, 1995) , GDA (Hashida, 2005) , Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2006) , BCCWJ-PT (Takeuchi et al., 2015) ). However, numbered semantic roles have not been annotated for Japanese texts. Also, none of the annotated corpora that are reported in the literature are web accessible because of licensing restrictions 2 . 1 LDC2017T10 and LDC2014T12. 2 Japanese FrameNet is constructed on the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ) (Maekawa et al., 2014) , from which it inherits release issues. Thus, the annotated sentences are not available on the website: http://sato.fm.senshu-u.ac.jp/frameSQL/jfn23/notes/index2.html (accessed 2019/11/22). In this research project, we annotate two types of semantic role labels and frames of predicates from the NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese (NPCMJ), which is a freely available web-accessible treebank (NINJAL, 2016) 3 . The semantic roles and frames are annotated based on a freely available web-accessible thesaurus of predicateargument structure for Japanese (PT) 4 . Utilizing the tree structure of the NPCMJ, we can focus directly on the problem of labeling for the semantic roles and frames of target predicates. This is because the identification of target predicates and their arguments can be automatically derived from the treebank following (Horn et al., 2018) . The first type of annotation for semantic roles is PropBankstyle, that is, numbered semantic roles. The second type involves names for semantic roles (e.g., Agent, Theme, Goal), which has been used in PT. The reason why we employ the conventional named semantic roles is that the named semantic roles are intuitively more understandable for humans compared to the numbered roles. Thus, the named roles are expected to be used in queries when language learners or linguists want to extract example sentences that, e.g., contain \"Experiencer\" arguments in the emotional sense, or \"Source\" arguments in the moving sense. Contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) For NLP researchers, linguists, and Japanese language learners, we propose a dual semantic role annotation that is composed of: (i) numbered semantic roles, and (ii) semantic roles with conventional names. (2) The proposed numbered semantic roles are framebased so that roles can be assigned consistently with regards to their corresponding frame. (3) We reveal that the frame-based semantic roles are suitable for Japanese because of dividing transitive and intransitive verbs. (4) We show that the current annotated predicates are about 10,000, and reveal highly promising accuracy results from a semantic role annotation system with a neural network model. Frame-Based Semantic Roles 2.1. Frame-based Semantic Roles Are Needed in an Agglutinative Language Such as Japanese With semantic role annotation, the aim is to fix the semantic relations between arguments and predicates in a manner that is abstracted away from differences between case markers and syntactic alternations. One of the difficulties of annotating semantic roles with names involves settling on a system of names, such as Agent, Theme, and Patient. Several different systems of semantic roles are proposed in previous studies (Fillmore, 1968; Palmer et al., 2010; Loper et al., 2007; Baker et al., 1998) . By contrast, the numbered semantic roles proposed in PropBank can absorb these differences, because numbered arguments can be consistently assigned in example sentences for the target verb sense. In Japanese, some verbs, e.g., 'hirak-u' (open), behave as both intransitive and transitive verbs without any intransitivizing or transitivizing suffix 5 . (5) a. Intransitive and transitive pairs similar to 'ak-u' and 'ak-eru' above are registered as different lexical units in morphological analyzers (e.g., MeCab 6 ) as well as Japanese dictionaries even though they share the same stem. However, they share the same semantic role set. This is why we need to assign the same semantic role set and frame (that is, frame-based semantic roles) to each verb. Thus, we define a frame that indicates a shared concept of predicates that belong to the frame, and then the frame unites a consistent semantic role set. Each verb meaning of polysemous verbs is fixed by adding example sentences. Since a polysemous verb has several meanings, each verb meaning is connected to a distinct frame. For example, the verb 'hirak-u', shown in (5), has another meaning as in (7). The meaning of 'hirak-u' in ( 7 ) is assigned to the development frame to which verbs such as 'kaitaku-su-ru' (cultivate) and 'kaihatsu-su-ru' (develop) are also assigned. PT: Repository of Semantic Roles and Frames for Japanese Predicates As a base repository of semantic roles and frames for Japanese predicates, we use PT. PT is composed of hierarchical frames for predicates and each frame indicates a shared meaning of predicates whose sense is designated with semantic-role-annotated example sentences. In previous work (Takeuchi et al., 2010) , PT was constructed for about 11,000 Japanese predicates, with about 23,000 annotated example sentences. The semantic roles in PT have conventional role names (e.g., Agent, Theme, Goal) 7 . Thus, by adding PropBank-style semantic roles to the example sentences in PT, we utilize PT as a repository of frames containing frame based semantic roles that are both numbered and named for Japanese predicates. Figure 1 shows an example of how the verb 'hirak-u' is registered in PT. As a polysemous verb, 'hirak-u' has open, develop, and start meanings. Each word meaning has an example sentence that is annotated with both numbered semantic roles and named semantic roles. The semantic roles are Arg1 and Theme in all of the example sentences 8 in Figure 1 . !\"#$%&'(# )*#+%&'*,%(#-.

Then each example sentence is linked to a frame in the thesaurus. For example, the meaning of 'hanaya o hirak-u' (someone starts the flower shop) is assigned to start 9 whose frame ID is 366. The start frame also contains 'kigyoosu-ru' (start new venture) and 'kaiten-su-ru' (open a shop). The structure of frames is a thesaurus. There is no multiple inheritance in the thesaurus of frames. Such structure is similar to a synset in WordNet. Frame-based numbered semantic roles are convenient to capture the same type of arguments with different named roles for different verbs in the same frame. For example, both predicate verbs 'oros-u' (get down) and 'ochi-ru' (fall) in ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) belong to the moving from frame. In the moving from frame, the mover of the moving event is annotated as Arg0 and Agent. This raises concern for (9), where it is 'chichi' (father) who is moved. For such a 8 Subjects (i.e., Arg0) are often omitted in Japanese, even when the verb is transitive. 9 To be exact, this is the change of state/start end/start frame. For simplicity, we often omit to write the hierarchy of the frame. case, 'chichi' is annoated with the Experiencer named semantic role because 'chichi' is moved without intending to be moved. According to the annotation guidelines of Prop-Bank (Bonial et al., 2010) , Experiencer is typically Arg0 in numbered roles. However, the numbered role Arg1 is usually assigned to the Patient argument, i.e. \"the argument which undergoes the change of state or is being affected by the action\". Consequently, 'chichi' is annotataed as Arg1 in (9), so as to be consistent in the meaning of something which moves, i.e., 'hon' (book) and 'chichi' (father) in the sentences. On the other hand, named semantic roles are helpful for understanding the meanings of arguments. The named semantic roles are annotated across frames, and thus the same type of arguments can be extracted, while arguments numbered Arg2 or with a higher number depend on each frame 10 . In ( 10 ) and ( 11 ), even though the frames are different, 'kangoshi' (nurse) and 'asshoo' (big win) are a complement of the argument with the accusative case marker. For the arguments, the named semantic role is Complement (ACC) that indicates a complement of the argument with accusative case. Framework of Annotation Task As mentioned in the previous section, the repository of semantic roles and frames (i.e., PT) is web-accessible, and has search functionality so annotators can look up example sentences in PT. The annotation task is carried out by annotators under the guidance of a supervisor. Figure 2 gives an overview of the annotation task. The procedure of annotation of semantic roles and frames on the NPCMJ is as follows: 1. Target predicates and their arguments are extracted by a program (Treebank Semantics) (Butler, 2019) . This works by converting constituency tree annotations into logic based meaning representations from which 10 From the standpoint of Construction Grammar (Goldberg, 1995) , the named semantic roles and the numbered semantic roles can be regarded as 'argument roles' and 'patient roles', respectively. The named semantic roles are annotated according to syntactic expressions of arguments for verbs, while the numbered semantic roles are annotated based on frames. predicate-argument information can be extracted and remapped back into the tree structures of the NPCMJ for identifying target predicates and their arguments. 2. Annotators select the target sentence, look up a target predicate for an example, find the most appropriate frame for the example, and then assign the frame ID number to the target predicate. 3. Then, annotators assign semantic roles to the arguments according to the examples in PT. 4. If annotators find cases that are missing from PT or annotators are not confident, annotators write a report. 5. The supervisor adds new examples to PT or has discussions with annotators according to their reports 11 . In step 2, annotators can see the dependencies of the target sentence on the NPCMJ server (Figure 3 ). Since the NPCMJ is a web-accessible treebank, annotators can also look at the tree view of the target sentence from the same webpage (Figure 4 ). As can be seen in Figure 2 , annotators input frame IDs and semantic roles directly into the NPCMJ server, then the annotated results can be checked by all the other annotators and the supervisor. The frames of PT were constructed on the basis of the Lexeed database (Fujita et al., 2006) . This database is a sense 11 Currently there are three annotators working on the project. Discussions with the supervisor are used to settle all cases where annotators are not confident. repository for a rule-based machine translation system. It follows that the frames of PT have a wide coverage for frequent predicates. However, there remain words and word meanings that have not been registered. Adding new words or example sentences to PT is limited to the supervisor only so as to maintain the consistency of the dictionary. A problem with this setup is that the operation of extending PT could become a bottleneck for the annotation. !\"\"#$%#%&'()& &*+,-.&) /0123#4%&&#5+67 !66$4+4$%) \"&-&6\"&689#\"+4+ +66$4+4&\"#\"+4+ /0123#)&%'&% !\"\"#%$.&)#+6\"#:%+,&) 0; <*+,-.&)#$:#)&,+64(8 %$.&)#+6\"#:%+,&) =$$7#>- )>-&%'()$%# ?&-$%4# >6+66$4+4&\" 8+)&) 0%$5.&, %&-$%4) \"()8>))($6) ;+)7#$:#+66$4+4$%) ;+)7#$:#)>-&%'()$% Examples of Complicated Annotations With the annotation task, we found syntactic and grammatical variations because, as a corpus, the NPCMJ is composed of texts from very diverse genres, such as white papers, novels, speech dictations, news papers, and so on. Here we show some complicated cases of semantic role annotations. Causative form As described in Section 2.1., some transitive verbs have corresponding intransitive verbs. Both verbs can take the causative form. In PT numbered arguments and named roles are assigned on the basis of active voice. Note that causative forms of intransitive verbs exhibit structure similar to transitive verbs. Passive form Japanese has several special grammatical forms in the passive voice. The first one is the adversative passive (Wierzbicka, 1979) , that is, the passive form for an intransitive verb. Light verbs Japanese often uses the light verb construction. For this construction, there is an argument that works as the predicate, and so this argument that provides the predicate content is withdrawn from being assigned a semantic role. For example, consider (18). ( 18 In ( 18 ), the target verb 'shi-ma-su' (do) is a light verb. The content of the action is expressed by the deverbal noun 'oshaberi' (chatting). For this light verb case, the Arg PRX tag is assigned to the content argument 'oshaberi o'. This follows the treatment proposed in the PropBank guidelines (Bonial et al., 2010) . However, the composed meaning of the light verb construction, i.e., the chat frame and the verb 'oshaberi-sur-u' (chat-do-PRS) are assigned to the light verb 'shi-ma-su'. Thus the role sets of the chat frame are applied to the arguments and adjuncts except for 'oshaberi o' (ArgM PRX). Current Annotation Results In this section we discuss the current state of annotation. First, we show the statistics of annotated numbers of sentences, target predicates, types of predicates, and semantic roles. Second, we apply the annotated corpus to a machine learning system to estimate roughly the quality of annotated semantic roles with comparison to previous studies. Currently we are completing the first round of annotation that we plan to review. Statistics of Annotated Data Preliminary Experiments of Semantic Role Labeling Using Deep Learning Model Motivation Previous work has constructed a semantic role labeling system with neural network models for Japanese (Okamura et al., 2019) . The target data is BCCWJ-PT, where data is annotated with the semantic roles defined in PT. While the sentences in BCCWJ-PT are different from those of the NPCMJ, we can roughly estimate the quality of the named semantic roles in the NPCMJ by comparing the accuracy of a semantic role labeling system using the NPCMJ to the case of using BCCWJ-PT. Semantic role labeling system The input of the semantic role labeling system is the target predicate and morpheme sequence of its argument (or adjunct), and then the output is a semantic role label of the argument. All of the morphemes are converted to d dimension vectors with nwjc2vec, which gives Japanese word vectors 13 . Let X be a vector sequence of an input morpheme sequence, that is, X = x 1 , . . . , x t , . . . , x T (x t \u2208 R d ). Let S be output of a semantic role label for input X, the estimated semantic role label is defined by Formula (1). \u015c = argmax j\u2208Sem p(S j |X) (1) Where, Sem is a set of semantic role labels, and S j (j = 1, . . . , Sem) is the jth semantic role label. Let y j be an output of the jth unit at the final output layer of the neural network model. Since the softmax function is used as a non-linear function at the output layer, y j can be a probability. y j = p(S j |X). (2) Then \u015c can be estimated by using a neural network. As a neural network model, we apply bi-directional GRU with the max-pooling model (hereafter referred to as the bi-GRU model) to the semantic role labeling because the bi-GRU model gave the best performance in the previous study of Okamura et al. (2019) .

An input vector sequence X is applied to the input of bi-directional GRU, and then the max-pooling is applied to outputs of the GRU with time sequence direction. The final output y = [y 1 , . . . , y j , . . . , y Sem ] is obtained after applying a fullyconnected layer to the results of max-pooling. Experimental setup The number of hidden units of GRU is 256. The settings of the optimizer are set the same as in Okamura et al. (2019) . The annotated data is divided into 65%, 5%, and 30% for training, development, and test data, respectively. The performance is evaluated by the accuracy of the test data. Accuracy = # Estimated semantic roles are correct # All instances (3) Experimental results Table 4 shows the total accuracies of numbered and named semantic role labels. The accuracy of the third column shows the results for BCCWJ-PT (Okamura et al., 2019) . According to the accuracies of named semantic roles in Ta-NPCMJ BCCWJ-PT Numbered semantic roles 0.716 N/A Named semantic roles 0.667 0.702 Table 4 : Total accuracy of semantic roles ble 4, the accuracy of the model using NPCMJ is near to that of BCCWJ-PT. BCCWJ-PT was annotated with two annotators for each semantic role as well as being checked by a third annotator, and so the quality of annotated semantic roles is expected to be high. The above results indicate that for the current annotated semantic roles of the NPCMJ the consistency of the annotated tags is promising for a resource that is under development. Comparing numbered and named semantic roles in their accuracy, numbered semantic roles are higher than named semantic roles. The result can be considered to show that the numbered semantic roles are annotated more consistently than the named semantic roles. Comparing the accuracy of numbered semantic roles to the results for the shared task in English semantic role labeling tasks, we have to improve our semantic role labeling models. Discussions One of the difficulties of annotating semantic roles is to discriminate between arguments and adjuncts, while keeping frame consistency in PT. Arguments are the essential factors for the defined frame, while adjuncts are not core elements for a frame. In principle, adjuncts can be attached to any frame. As described in Section 2.1. we added Arg0, Arg1, etc. tags to the previously defined named semantic roles in PT for the frame repository. However, because of the lack of variation in the example sentences, we have found arguments to be missing. This applies especially to arguments that are inserted as parts of constructions. Consider (19), and the need for a create frame that contains the meaning of the verb 'kak-u' (write). For (19), we need to define two essential semantic roles, namely: Arg0 (Agent, writer) and Arg1 (Theme, written thing). ( The recipient 'imooto-ni' (sister DAT) must be part of a construction (Goldberg, 1995) . Thus, the recipient can be considered as an argument because the recipient appears depending on the create frame. We can also confirm the semantic role of the above 'recipient' case by looking at the corresponding examples in English PropBank and FrameNet. In the frameset write.01 of PropBank, the corresponding roles are defined as A2 (benefactive), that is an essential argument. In FrameNet, the frames are more detailed than our frames in PT. The meaning of the above case, i.e., 'write' in English, is assigned to the Contacting frame. In the Contacting frame, the recipient role is defined as the Addressee role that indicates a core role (i.e., an essential argument). Thus both English language resources offer an analysis that is the same as our analysis for the Japanese data. Next, consider (21) 14 , which is another example that is not registered in PT. Frame: create '(They) write it as \"Shomyo\" in the old kanji style' (5 wikipedia KYOTO 11) We are currently investigating whether the two phrases ('kyuujitai de' and 'shoomyoo to') are arguments and/or adjuncts for the create frame of PT. According to FrameNet, the verb 'write' can belong to the Statement, Text creation, Contacting and Spelling and pronouncing frames. The create in PT can partially correspond to the Text creation frame. However, it is the Spelling and pronouncing frame that seems to correspond to (21). In the Spelling and pronouncing frame, 'kyuujitai de' might correspond to Manner and 'shoomyoo to' to Formal realization; and both roles are defined as core roles. This is suggestive evidence that FrameNet has analyzed examples that can be expected to cover Japanese examples too, even though Japanese has different syntactic and grammatical characteristics when compared to English. Thus we think it will be helpful to refer to existing language resources, especially PropBank and FrameNet, in revising framesets in PT. Such comparisons are only possible because there are web-accessible frame data sets, notably, PropBank and FrameNet. Thus, we believe that providing the NPCMJ and the frame repository PT as web-accessible resources is essential for being able to construct reliable semantic role labeled language resources for Japanese and beyond. Conclusion This paper has described ongoing research of constructing an annotated corpus of semantic roles and frames as an addition to the NPCMJ, a Japanese web-accessible parsed corpus. The annotation task is coupled with the expansion of PT, that is, the repository of semantic roles and frames. We annotate two types of semantic roles, i.e., numbered and named semantic roles for the arguments. Both the numbered semantic roles and the named semantic roles are defined consistently with respect to frames. Then numbered semantic roles are expected to be used in NLP, and the named roles are to be used as tags for searching example sentences by language learners and linguists. In the annotated texts, we have found various kinds of syntactical and grammatical variations: e.g., adversative passives, alternations of cases, and collocations. We also applied part of the annotated corpus into a semantic role annotation model based on neural networks to evaluate how the annotated corpus can contribute to the statistical learning model approach. The results show that the accuracies of semantic role annotation systems are almost the same as the current quality of named semantic roles, for results near to the achievements of previous work. Thus, we can estimate that the quality of the annotated semantic roles are highly promising. What is currently annotated is the first part of a planned annotation cycle, and so all is due for review as we also continue to annotate new texts from the NPCMJ. The NPCMJ is planned to increase in size to 60,000 sentences.
