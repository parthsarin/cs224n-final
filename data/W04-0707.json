The inclusion of such detectors was motivated by the observation that more than 50% of definite descriptions (DDs) in an average corpus are discourse new (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) , but whereas the inclusion of detectors for non-anaphoric pronouns in algorithms such as Lappin and Leass' (1994) leads to clear improvements in precision, the improvements in anaphoric DD resolution (as opposed to classification) brought about by the detectors were rather small. In fact, Ng and Cardie (2002a) challenged the motivation for the inclusion of such detectors, reporting no improvements, or even worse performance. We re-examine the literature on the topic in detail, and propose a revised algorithm, taking advantage of the improved discourse-new detection techniques developed by Uryupina (2003) . Introduction Although many theories of definiteness and many anaphora resolution algorithms are based on the assumption that definite descriptions are anaphoric, in fact in most corpora at least half of definite descriptions are DISCOURSE-NEW (Prince, 1992) , as shown by the following examples, both of which are the first sentences of texts from the Penn Treebank.

Vieira and Poesio (2000) proposed an algorithm for definite description resolution that incorporates a number of heuristics for detecting discourse-new (henceforth: DN) descriptions. But whereas the inclusion of detectors for non-anaphoric pronouns (e.g., It in It's raining) in algorithms such as Lappin and Leass' (1994) leads to clear improvements in precision, the improvements in anaphoric DD resolution (as opposed to classification) brought about by the detectors were rather small. In fact, Ng and Cardie (2002a) challenged the motivation for the inclusion of such detectors, reporting no improvements or even worse performance. We reexamine the literature on the topic in detail, and propose a revised algorithm, taking advantage of the improved DN detection techniques developed by Uryupina (2003) . 2 Detecting Discourse-New Definite Descriptions 2.1 Vieira and Poesio Poesio and Vieira (1998) carried out corpus studies indicating that in corpora like the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) , around 52% of DDs are discourse-new (Prince, 1992) , and another 15% or so are bridging references, for a total of about 66-67% firstmention. These results led Vieira and Poesio to propose a definite description resolution algorithm incorporating independent heuristic strategies for recognizing DN definite descriptions (Vieira, 1998; Vieira and Poesio, 2000) . The heuristics proposed by Vieira and Poesio assumed a parsed input (the Penn Treebank) and aimed at identifying five categories of DDs licensed to occur as first mention on semantic or pragmatic grounds on the basis of work on definiteness including Loebner's account (1987) : 1. So-called SEMANTICALLY FUNCTIONAL de-scriptions (Loebner, 1987) . This class included descriptions with modifiers like first or best that turned a possibly sortal predicate into a function (as in the first person to cross the Pacific on a row boat); as well as descriptions with predicates like fact or belief followed by a that-clause with the function of specifying the fact or belief under question. Both types of definites descriptions were recognized by consulting a hand-coded list of SPECIAL PREDI-CATES. (Loebner, 1987) and prepositional phrases, as in The hotel where we stayed last night was pretty good. Descriptions serving as disguised These heuristics, as well, examined the syntactic structure of the NP. (Hawkins, 1978) , i.e., definite descriptions like the sun, the pope or the long distance market which denote uniquely on the grounds of shared knowledge about the situation (these are Loebner's 'situational functions'). Vieira and Poesio's system had a small list of such definites. LARGER SITUATION definite descriptions These heuristics were included as tests both of a decision tree concerned only with the task of DN detection, and of decision trees determining the classification of DDs as anaphoric, bridging or discourse new. In both cases, the DN detection tests were intertwined with attempts to identify an antecedent for such DDs. Both hand-coded decision trees and automatically acquired ones (trained using ID3, (Quin-lan, 1986 )) were used for the task of two-way classification into discourse-new and anaphoric. Vieira and Poesio found only small differences in the order of tests in the two decision trees, and small differences in performance. The hand-coded decision tree executes in the following order: 1.  (Note that as in the machine-learned version of the Vieira and Poesio decision tree, a (simplified) direct anaphora test is tried first, followed by DN detectors in decreasing order of accuracy.) Bean and Riloff trained their system on 1600 articles from MUC-4, and tested it on 50 texts. The S1 extraction methods produced 849 DDs; the DO list contained 65 head nouns and 321 full NPs. The overall results are shown in Table 2 ; the baseline are the results obtained when classifying all DDs as discourse-new. Although the overall precision is not better than what obtained with the partial hand-coded decision tree used by Vieira and Poesio, recall is substantially improved. Ng and Cardie (2002a) (Ng and Cardie, 2002b) ). Ng and Cardie's work differs from the work discussed so far in that their system attempts to deal with all types of NPs, not just definite descriptions. Ng and Cardie The discourse-new detectors proposed by Ng and Cardie are statistical classifiers taking as input 37 features and trained using either C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) or RIPPER (Cohen, 1995) . The 37 features of a candidate anaphoric expression specify, in addition to much of the information proposed in previous work, a few new types of information about NPs. \u2022 The four boolean so-called LEXICAL features are actually string-level features: for example, str_match is Y if a preceding NP string-matches the anaphoric expression (except for the determiner), and head_match = Y if a preceding NP's head string-matches the anaphoric expression's. embedded=Y if the anaphoric expression is a prenominal modifier. \u2022 The second group of 11 (mostly boolean) features specifies the type of NP: e.g., pronoun is Y if the anaphoric expression is a pronoun, else N. \u2022 The third group of 7 features specifies syntactic properties of the anaphoric expression, including number, whether NP j is the first of two NPs in an appositive or predicative construction, whether NP j is pre-or post-modified, whether it contains a proper noun, and whether it is modified by a superlative. \u2022 The next group of 8 features are mostly novel, and capture information not used by previous DN detectors about the exact composition of definite descriptions: e.g., the_2n=Y if the anaphoric expression starts with determiner the followed by exactly two common nouns, the_num_n=Y if the anaphoric expression starts with determiner the followed by a cardinal and a common noun, and the_sing_n=Y if the anaphoric expression starts with determiner the followed by a singular NP not containing a proper noun. \u2022 The next group of features consists of 4 features capturing a variety of 'semantic' information, including whether a previous NP is an 'alias' of NP j , or whether NP j is the title of a person (the president). \u2022 Finally, the last three features capture information about the position in the text in which NP j occurs: the header, the first sentence, or the first paragraph. Ng and Cardie's discourse-new predictor was trained and tested over the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference data sets, achieving accuracies of 86.1% and 84%, respectively, against a baseline of 63.8% and 73.2%, respectively. Inspection of the top parts of the decision tree produced with the MUC-6 suggests that head_match is the most important feature, followed by the features specifying NP type, the alias feature, and the features specifying the structure of definite descriptions. Ng and Cardie discuss two architectures for the integration of a DN detector in a coreference system. In the first architecture, the DN detector is run first, and the coreference resolution algorithm is run only if the DN detector classifies that NP as anaphoric. In the second architecture, the system first computes str_match and alias, and runs the anaphoric resolver if any of them is Y; otherwise, it proceeds as in the first architecture. The results obtained on the MUC-6 data with the baseline anaphoric resolver, the anaphoric resolver augmented by a DN detector as in the first architecture, and as in the second architecture (using C4.5), are shown in Table 3 . The results for all NPs, pronouns only, proper names only, and common nouns only are shown. 2  As indicated in the Table, running the DN detector first leads to worse results-this is because the detector misclassifies a number of anaphoric NPs as nonanaphoric. However, looking first for a same-head antecedent leads to a statistically significant improvement over the results of the baseline anaphoric resolver. This confirms the finding both of Vieira and Poesio and of Bean and Riloff that the direct anaphora should be called very early. 2 It's not clear to us why the overall performance of the algorithm is much better than the performance on the three individual types of anaphoric expressions considered-i.e., which other anaphoric expressions are handled by the coreference resolver. The first result to note is that both of Uryupina's classifiers work very well, particularly the uniqueness classifier. These tables also show that the definite probability helps somewhat the discourse new detector, but is especially useful for the uniqueness detector, as one would expect on the basis of Loebner's discussion. Summary Quite a lot of consensus on many of the factors playing a role in DN detection for DDs. Most of the algorithms discussed above incorporate methods for: \u2022 recognizing predicative DDs; \u2022 recognizing discourse-new proper names; \u2022 identifying functional DDs; \u2022 recognizing DDs modified by establishing relatives (which may or may not be discoursenew). There is also consensus on the fact that DN detection cannot be isolated from anaphoric resolution (witness the Ng and Cardie results). One problem with some of the machine learning approaches to coreference is that these systems do not achieve very good results on pronoun and definite description resolution in comparison with specialized algorithms: e.g., although Ng and Cardie's best version achieves F=65.8 on all anaphoric expressions, it only achieves F=29.6 for definite descriptions (cfr. Vieira and Poesio's best result of F=77), and F=28.2 for pronouns (as opposed to results as high as F=80 obtained by the pronoun resolution algorithms evaluated in (Tetreault, 2001) ). Clearly these systems can only be properly compared by evaluating them all on the same corpora and the same data, and discussion such as (Mitkov, 2000) suggest caution in interpreting some of the results discussed in the literature as pre-and postprocessing often plays a crucial role, but we feel that evaluating DN detectors in conjunction with highperforming systems would give a better idea of the improvements that one may hope to achieve. Do Discourse-New Detectors Help? Preliminary Evaluations Vieira and Poesio did not test their system without DN-detection, but Ng and Cardie's results indicate that DN detection does improve results, if not dramatically, provided that the same_head test is run first-although their DN detector does not appear to improve results for pronouns, the one category for which detection of non-anaphoricity has been shown to be essential (Lappin and Leass, 1994) . In order to evaluate how much improvement can we expect by just improving the DN detector, we did a few preliminary evaluations both with a reimplementation of Vieira and Poesio's algorithm which does not include a discourse-new detector, running over treebank text as the original algorithm, and with a simple statistical coreference resolver attempting to resolve all anaphoric expressions and running over unparsed text, using Uryupina's features for discourse-new detection, and over the same corpus used by Ng and Cardie (MUC-7). How much does DN-detection help the Vieira / Poesio algorithm? GUITAR (Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004 ) is a general-purpose anaphoric resolver that includes an implementation of the Vieira / Poesio algorithm for definite descriptions and of Mitkov's algorithm for pronoun resolution (Mitkov, 1998) . It is implemented in Java, takes its input in XML format and returns as output its input augmented with the anaphoric relations it has discovered. GUITAR has been implemented in such a way as to be fully modular, making it possible, for example, to replace the DD resolution method with alternative implementations. It includes a pre-processor incorporating a chunker so that it can run over both hand-parsed and raw text. A version of GUITAR without the DN detection aspects of the Vieira / Poesio algorithm was evaluated on the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000; Poesio et al., 2004) , which contains 554 definite descriptions, of which 180 anaphoric, and 305 third-person pronouns, of which 217 anaphoric. The results for definite descriptions over hand-parsed text are shown in Table 6 . How much might DN detection help a simple statistical coreference resolver? In order to have an even closer comparison with the results of Ng and Cardie, we implemented a simple statistical coreference system, that, like Ng and Cardie's system, would resolve all types of anaphoric expressions, and would run over unparsed text, but without DN detection. We ran the system over the MUC-7 data used by Ng and Cardie, and compared the results with those obtained by using perfect knowledge about discourse novelty. The results are shown in These results suggest that a DN detector could lead to substantial improvements for coreference resolution in general: DN detection might improve precision by more than 30%, which more than makes up for the slight deterioration in recall. Of course, this test alone doesn't tell us how much improvement DN detection would bring to a higherperformance anaphoric resolver. A New Set of Features for Discourse-New Detection Next, we developed a new set of features for discourse new detection that takes into account the findings of the work on DN detection discussed in the previous sections. This set of features will be input to an anaphoric resolver for DDs working in two steps. For each DD, 1. The direct anaphora resolution algorithm from (Vieira and Poesio, 2000) is run, which attempts to find an head-matching antecedent within a given window and taking premodification into account. The results of the algorithm (i.e., whether an antecedent was found) is used as one of the input features of the classifier in the next step. In addition, a number of features of the DD that may help recognizing the classes of DDs discussed above are extracted from the input. Some of these features are computed accessing the Web via the Google API. 2. A decision tree classifier is used to classify the DD as anaphoric (in which case the antecedents identified at the first step are also returned) or discourse-new. The features input to the classifier can be categorized as follows: Anaphora A single feature, direct-anaphora, specifying the distance of the (same-head) antecedent from the DD, if any (values: none, zero, one, more) Predicative NPs Two boolean features: \u2022 apposition, if the DD occurs in appositive position; \u2022 copular, if the DD occurs in post-verbal position in a copular construction. Proper Names Three boolean features: \u2022 c-head: whether the head is capitalized; \u2022 c-premod: whether one of the premodifiers is capitalized; \u2022 S1: whether the DD occurs in the first sentence of a Web page. Functionality The four definite probabilities used by Uryupina (computed accessing the Web), plus a superlative feature specifying if one of the premodifiers is a superlative, extracted from the part of speech tags. Establishing relative A single feature, specifying whether NP is postmodified, and by a relative clause or a prepositional phrase; Text Position Whether the DD occurs in the title, the first sentence, or the first paragraph. We are testing several classifiers included in the Weka 3.4 library (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/\u02dcml/) including an implementation of C4.5 and a multi-layer perceptron. Evaluation Data We are using three corpora for the evaluation, including texts from different genres, in which all anaphoric relations between (all types of) NPs are marked. The GNOME corpus includes pharmaceutical leaflets and museum 'labels' (i.e., descriptions of museum objects and of the artists that realized them). As said above, the corpus contains 554 definite descriptions. In addition, we are using the 14 texts from the Penn Treebank included in the corpus used by Vieira and Poesio. We transferred these texts to XML format, and added anaphoric information for all types of NPs according to the GNOME scheme. Finally, we are testing the system on the MUC-7 data used by Ng and Cardie Methods We will compare three versions of the DD resolution component: 1. The baseline algorithm without DN detection incorporated in GUITAR described above (i.e., only the direct anaphora resolution part of (Vieira and Poesio, 2000) ); 2. A complete implementation of the Vieira and Poesio algorithm, including also the DN detecting heuristics; 3. An algorithm using the statistical classifier discussed above. Results Regrettably, the system is still being tested. We will report the results at the workshop. Discussion and Conclusions Discussions and conclusions will be based on the final results.
