    "article": "This paper provides the system description of the IHMM team of Dublin City University for our participation in the system combination task in the Second Workshop on Applying Machine Learning Techniques to Optimise the Division of Labour in Hybrid MT (ML4HMT-12). Our work is based on a confusion network-based approach to system combination. We propose a new method to build a confusion network for this: (1) incorporate extra alignment information extracted from given meta data, treating them as sure alignments, into the results from IHMM, and ( 2 ) decode together with this information. We also heuristically set one of the system outputs as the default backbone. Our results show that this backbone, which is the RBMT system output, achieves an 0.11% improvement in BLEU over the backbone chosen by TER, while the extra information we added in the decoding part does not improve the results. Introduction This paper describes a new extension to our system combination module in Dublin City University for the participation in the system combination task in the ML4HMT-2012 workshop. We incorporate alignment meta information to the alignment module when building a confusion network. Given multiple translation outputs, a system combination strategy aims at finding the best translations, either by choosing one sentence or generating a new translation from fragments originated from individual systems (Banerjee et al., 2010) . Combination methods have been widely used in fields such as parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999) and speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997) . In late the 90s, the speech recognition community produced a confusion network-based system combination approach, spreading instantly to SMT community as well. The traditional system combination approach employs confusion networks which are built by the monolingual alignment which induces sentence similarity. Confusion networks are compact graph-based structures representing multiple hypothesises (Bangalore et al., 2001) . It is noted that there are several generalized forms of confusion networks as well. One is a lattice (Feng et al., 2009) and the other is a translation forest (Watanabe and Sumita, 2011) . The former employs lattices that can describe arbitrary mappings in hypothesis alignments. A lattice is more general than a confusion network. By contrast, a confusion forest exploits syntactic similarity between individual outputs. Up to now, various state-of-the-art alignment methods have been developed including Indirect-HMM (He et al., 2008; Du and Way, 2010) which is a statistical-model-based method, and TER which is a metric-based method which uses an edit distance. In this work we focus on the IHMM method. The main problem of IHMM is that there are numerous one-to-many and one-to-null cases in the alignment results. This alignment noise significantly affects the confusion network construction and the decoding process. In this work, in addition to the IHMM alignment, we also incorporate alignment meta information extracted from an RBMT system to help the decoding process. The other crucial factor is the backbone selection which also affects the combination results. The backbone determines the word order in the final output. Backbone selection is often done by Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding which selects a hypothesis with minimum average distance among all hypotheses (Rosti et al., 2007a,b) . In this work we heuristically choose an RBMT output as the backbone due to its (expected) overall grammatically well-formed output and better human evaluation results. We report our results and provide a comparison with traditional confusion-network-based network approach. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: We will review the state-of-the-art system combination framework based on confusion networks in Section 2. We describe our experimental setup, how we extract the alignment information from meta-data and how we use it in Section 3. The results and analysis are also given in this section. We draw conclusions in Section 4. Background on Confusion Networks Confusion Network Architecture The current state-of-art approach to word level system combination is described in (Rosti et al., 2007b) . The system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 . Suppose we have collected four system outputs H 1 -H 4 which are shown in Figure 2a . Then the traditional way of choosing a backbone is to use minimum average edit distance (or other measurements) as shown in Equation 1 . B = H * = ar g min H\u2208\u2207 H\u2208\u2207 (H i , H) (1) The backbone is used to decide the word order of the final output. After obtaining the backbone, all other hypotheses are aligned to it. The alignment strategies include IHMM, TER, etc. Note that during the word alignment word reordering and 'null' insertion are performed, which is usually called normalization. The confusion network, which can be constructed directly from the normalized alignment is given in Figure 2b , in which case H 1 is chosen as the backbone. Indirect HMM Alignment In this work we implement the IHMM (He et al., 2008) . IHMM is a refined version of HMM alignment (Vogel et al., 1996) which is widely used in bilingual word alignment (Och and Ney, 2003) . Let B = (b 1 , ..., b J ) denote the J words in the backbone sentence, H = (h 1 , ..., h I ) denote one of the hypothesis, and A = (a 1 , ..., a J ) denote the alignment of each backbone word to the hypothesis word. We use Equation 2 to compute the alignment probability of each word pair. In Equation 2, d represents the distortion model and p denotes the word similarity model. P(H|B) = A j=1...J [d(a j |a j\u22121 , I)p(h j |b a j )] (2) In order to handle the words which are aligned to an empty word, we also insert a null associated with each backbone word. We follow (Vogel et al., 1996) and use Equation 3 to compute the distortion model. d(i|i , I) = c(i \u2212 i ) I l=1 c(l \u2212 i) (3) Where c(\u2206) represents the word distance grouped into c(\u2264 \u22124), c(\u22123), ..., c(0), ..., c(5), c(\u2265 6) 13 buckets, and computed with Equation 4 which peak at \u2206 = 1. c(\u2206) = (1 + |\u2206 \u2212 1|) \u22122 (4) The word similarity probability in Equation 2 is computed by Equation 5 . We use two small Chinese-English & English-Chinese dictionaries (10k entries each) to compute p semant ic , and the longest common subsequence matching score to obtain p sur f ace . p(h j |b i ) = \u03b1p semant ic (h j |b i ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)p sur f ace (h j |b i ) (5) Given an HMM model, we use the Viterbi algorithm to obtain the one-to-many alignment, and by reordering and inserting null to their proper position both in the backbone and hypothesis, the final normalized alignment are produced, as shown in Figure 2b . Decoding & Parameter tuning We use a log linear combination strategy shown in Equation 6 , which is described in (Rosti et al., 2007a) , to compute the hypothesis confidence. l og p(E|F ) = N nodes \u22121 i=1 lo g( N s yst em i=1 w l p(wor d|l, i)) + \u03bd Lm(E) + \u00b5N nul ls (E) + \u03b5Len(E) (6) where N nod es is the number of nodes the current confusion network has, N s yst em is the number of sytems, w denotes the system weight, Lm represents the language model score of the current path, N nul ls stands for the number of nulls inserted, and Len is the length of the current path. \u03bd ,\u00b5 and \u03b5 are the corresponding weights of each feature. A beam search algorithm is employed to find the best path. 3 Experimental Setup Data We participate in the ML4HMT-12 shared task ES-EN. Participants are given a development bilingual data set aligned at the sentence level. Each \"bilingual sentence\" contains: 1) the source sentence, 2) the target (reference) sentence and 3) the corresponding multiple output translations from four systems, based on different MT approaches (Ram\u0131rez-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2006; Alonso and Thurmair, 2003; Koehn et al., 2007) . The output has been annotated with system-internal meta-data information derived from the translation process of each of the systems. In this work we use 1000 sentence pair from the 10K development set to tune the system parameters and all the 3003 sentence pairs in the test set to run the test. Backbone Selection Equation 1 describes the traditional backbone selection. However in this work we heuristically set Lucy RBMT (Alonso and Thurmair, 2003) output as the backbone. Our motivations are that: 1) Lucy's output tends to be more grammatical than Moses or other MT systems; 2) according to the previous ML4HMT-2011, Lucy has better human evaluation scores than other statistical machine translation systems. Alignment Extraction of Lucy The Lucy LT RBMT (Alonso and Thurmair, 2003) takes three steps to translate a source language string into a target language string: an analysis step, a transfer step, and a generation step. The meta data annotations provided in ML4HMT development set follows these three steps describing the parse tree for the respective translation steps. We extract the alignment from this annotation in the following manner. First, we extract tuples where each connects a source word, intermediate words, and a target word by looking at the annotation file. There are some alignments dropped in this process. Such dropped alignments include the alignment of UNK (unknown)words marked by the Lucy LT RBMT system, words such as \"do\" which will not appear in the transfer step, and so forth. One remark is that since we trace these annotations based on the parse tree structure provided by the Lucy LT RBMT system, the exact order in the sentence is sometimes lost. This caused a problem when there are multiple \"the\", \"of\", and so forth, tokens in the string, so that for a given \"the\" in sources there are multiple target position. Second, we delete the intermediate representations, and obtain the source and the target words/phrases pairs. Examples of the extracted alignments (the second sentence in test set) are shown in Figure 3 . From Figure 3 we can see that words like '\u00faltimos' which has a one-to-one alignment are all correct alignments, while words like 'de' or 'el' which are involved in many-to-many alignment, carry much less confidence for the alignment. Given this observation, one idea would be using these extracted sure alignments, which are one-to-one, to guide decoding. Decoding with Alignment Bias In the decoding part, we change the Equation 6 into Equation 7 as follows p(E \u03c8 ) = \u03b8 \u03c8 lo g p(E \u03c8 |F ) (7) where \u03c8 = 1...N nodes denotes the current node at which the beam search arrived, and \u03b8 \u03c8 = 1 if a current node is not a sure alignment extracted from Lucy's meta-data and \u03b8 \u03c8 > 1, otherwise.

All development set and test set data are tokenized and lower cased. We use mteval-v13.pl 1 , no-smoothing and case sensitive for the evaluation. Table 1 shows the result of using Lucy as a backbone and the result of changing \u03b8 \u03c8 on the development and test sets. Note that \u03b8 \u03c8 = 1 stands for the case when there is no effect of this factor on the current path. 1 when \u03b8 \u03c8 = 1) with that of the TER backbone in Table 2 . We can see that the Lucy backbone result was 0.11% better than that of TER. This confirmed our assumption that Lucy would be a good backbone in system combination. Conclusion In this paper we describe new approaches we applied in building a confusion network. We focus on backbone selection and adding extra alignment information. Our results show that with choosing Lucy, which is an RBMT system, as a backbone the result is slightly better (0.11% improvment by BLEU) than the traditional TER backbone selection method. However the extra alignment information we added in the decoding part does not improve the performance. In our future work we will further analyse the reason for this.
