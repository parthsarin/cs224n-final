The result is a resource with almost 350,000 sentences annotated with more than 70,000 distinct MWEs of various types from both longitudinal and latitudinal corpora. This resource can be used for large scale language acquisition studies of how MWEs feature in child language. Focusing on compound nouns (CN), we then verify in a longitudinal study if there are differences in the distribution and compositionality of CNs in child-directed and child-produced sentences across ages. Moreover, using additional latitudinal data, we investigate if there are further differences in CN usage and in compositionality preferences. The results obtained for the child-produced sentences reflect CN distribution and compositionality in child-directed sentences. Introduction The increasing availability of psycholinguistic, lexical and ontological resources and of more precise and robust natural language processing tools has enabled the automatic annotation of language acquisition corpora with additional sources of information. In particular, among them resources like WordNet (Miller, 1995) and specialised datasets contain information about Multiword Expressions (MWEs) such as noun compounds (police car) (Kim and Baldwin, 2006; Nakov, 2008a) , phrasal verbs (break down) (McCarthy et al., 2003) and collocations (e.g. salt and pepper) (Seretan, 2011; Eryigit et al., 2011) . These resources can be used as basis for annotating MWE occurrence in corpora such as the English portion of the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) (MacWhinney, 1995) , which contains transcriptions of child language data. In this paper we introduce the resulting resource, CHILDES-MWE, which contains almost 350,000 English sentences annotated with more than 70,000 distinct MWEs of various types, including compound nouns and phrasal verbs. 1  The resulting annotated resource can be used as basis for language acquisition studies. In this paper we use it for examining how MWEs feature in child language, focusing on compound nouns (CNs) in English. Firstly, using longitudinal data, which follow specific children across time, we want to examine the link between the input and output of the children in terms of CNs, verifying if there are differences in the distribution of CNs in child-directed and child-produced sentences. Secondly, as in terms of semantics CNs range from compositional to idiomatic combinations, we want to determine if there is any effect of compositionality in the sentences to which children are exposed and in those they produce. This paper is structured as follows: in \u00a72 we describe some related work on MWEs and child language; and in \u00a73 we present CHILDES-MWE and describe the annotation pro- cess. The materials and methods used for this work are in \u00a74, along with an analysis of the results obtained. We finish with conclusions and future work in \u00a75. Learning Multiword Expressions In the psycholinguistic literature there has been considerable interest in questions about how people acquire, represent and process MWEs (Bod, 2001; Dahlmann and Adolphs, 2007) . Compounding in particular can be seen as a way of introducing new words into the lexicon (Gagn\u00e9 and Spalding, 2006) , and as being at the interface between morphology and syntax. As a consequence, to understand and produce compounds children need to learn to combine information at different levels of linguistic description. This includes how to order the elements of a compound, where the head is, how to do pluralization in a compound, which combinations are frozen and idiomatic and what their meaning is (Berman, 2011) . For the latter in particular, there is a wide range of variation, since while some MWEs are more compositional and their meaning can be derived from their component words (e.g. access road), others are more idiomatic and semantically unrelated to their component words (e.g. eager beaver). As MWEs can be lexically, syntactically, semantically, pragmatically and/or statistically idiosyncratic, they may be more challenging in terms of learning and require more than knowledge about single words and word-to-word relations for their adequate interpretation (Fillmore et al., 1988) . For instance, the meaning of an idiomatic MWEs like bite the dust cannot be inferred from the meanings of each of its components literally. This introduces a distinction between what a learner is able to infer from language and what must be explicitly stored, as possibly prefabricated units which are retrieved as a whole when needed (Wray, 2002) . MWEs are also frequently found in acquisition data, and for verb-particle constructions the types and tokens produced by children seem to be compatible and follow very closely those in language directed to children (Villavicencio et al., 2012a) . Moreover, they are present in child-directed sentences and from an early age, with 2-year-old children already understanding a modifier-head relation in compounds (Clark et al., 1985) . The same goes for child-produced sentences: Clark (1993) extensive diary data reports that her son used compounding for all his innovative nouns before age 2, and from then to age 4 for over 70% of them. This is also reported by other studies where compounds are used 80% of the time for spontaneous lexical innovations for English-speaking children under age 4, and for older children 63% of the time (Clark, 1993) . This may vary for other languages, but for Englishspeaking children this preference for compounding may be due to principles of transparency of meaning, simplicity of form (ease of construction) and productivity along with conventionality and contrast that have been used to explain the word formation devices that children adopt to augment their vocabulary (Clark, 2009) . For instance, simplicity of word form and semantic transparency feature early on in children's productions (Berman, 2011) , with compounds involving base word forms, and a direct link between form and meaning so that particular words in the compound contribute specific parts of the meaning (Clark, 1993; Berman, 2011) . Developmentally the acquisition of compounds starts with them being treated as unanalysed monolexemic labels (a single word), then as the juxtaposition of two nouns with no or limited inflection, before full correct inflection, and finally mastery of productive compounding (Berman, 2011) . This means that to describe a person who pushes wagons the compound would change for example from wagon boy to push wagon, pusher wagon and finally to wagon pusher during acquisition. Therefore, compounding is an important device for children to expand their vocabularies, and several factors play a role such as productivity, transparency and simplicity (Clark, 1993) , with the relation between the frequency of compounds in child-directed (CD) and in their acquisition and use in child-produced (CP) sentences in need of further investigation (Berman, 2011) . In this paper we examine the link between characteristics of CD and CP for MWEs, via a large-scale corpus investigation, concentrating on compound nouns. CHILDES-MWE The English CHILDES contains 60 subcorpora (12 from British English and 48 form North American English), with 895,130 word types in 4,845,264 sentences. We extended the data from the CHILDES Verb Construction Database (Villavicencio et al., 2012b) and annotated them with MWE information. The database contains morphological and syntactic information, along with psycholinguistic and distributional information including verb semantic classes, age of acquisition and familiarity. Details about CHILDES-MWE are in Table 1 , focusing on children of up to 7 years of age, given the relevance of this period for language acquisition, and their linguistic input (CD) and output (CP). To automatically annotate MWEs in corpora we used jMWE (Kulkarni and Finlayson, 2011) , defining a detector that finds all occurrences of MWEs, as specified in a list of MWE types. We prioritize precision only looking for MWEs whose components occur in the canonical order as consecutive elements without any intervening material, adopting the longest match from Left-to-Right. The list of target MWE types was obtained from lexical resources containing various types of MWEs: WN WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) CE Cranberry expressions dataset (Trawinski et al., 2008) containing MWEs whose components cannot be found outside the MWE (e.g. sandboy as happy as a sandboy). NC Noun Compounds datasets by Kim and Baldwin (2008) and Nakov (2008b) containing sequences of nouns (e.g. cheese knife). CN Compound Nominalizations (Nicholson and Baldwin, 2008) which are a subclass of compound nouns in which the head noun is deverbal (e.g. product replacement). LVC Light-Verb Constructions dataset (Tu and Roth, 2011) containing expressions where the verb has a light or supporting role and the meaning is mainly derived from the direct object noun like take a walk. VPC Verb-Particle Constructions dataset (Baldwin, 2008) with combinations of verbs and prepositional, adverbial or adjectival particles (e.g. break down). Cases of to <verb> (e.g. to come, and to break) and <pronoun> <verb>. 2 were not included. The final list contains 71,888 MWE types characterized as in Tables 2  and 3 . CHILDES-MWE contains 347,391 sentences annotated with MWEs, and details about a subset of these corpora are shown in Table 1 and in Figure 1 for children of ages 1 to 7.   Regarding the second hypothesis, there is a prevalence of compositional tokens in both CD and CP sentences, Figure 2 . Moreover, there is a high correlation between the number of compositional tokens (Spearman correlation = 0.63, p < 0.01) confirming that children tend to follow the preference for compositional tokens and the distribution found in child-directed sentences. These results are compatible with those found by Clark (1993) , in that CNs are found in corpora from an early age. Moreover, from an early age children also follow very closely the input they receive in terms of overall CN tokens and compositional (and non-compositional) CN tokens, which are similar to results obtained for verb-particle constructions (Villavicencio et al., 2012a) . Size Conclusion In this paper we presented CHILDES-MWE, a resource that provides MWE annotation for the English corpora in CHILDES . To ensure higher quality in the automatic annotation, we prioritized precision over recall, focusing on adjacent MWEs in canonical order. The resource contains 347,391 annotated sentences, and is one of the contributions of this work, as the resulting annotation is available to the community and can serve as a basis for language acqui-sition studies. We investigated the use of MWEs in naturalistic language acquisition data. We focused in the use of CN and compared the production of the children with the input coming from the adults. The results obtained in the analyses performed are that children tend to follow the CN usage of the adults. The relatively high Spearman correlations indicate that they tend produce more CNs if the hear more CNs. However the present study does not allow us to assert if this happens at the level of types, or if it is an overall effect reflecting the fact that children that are more familiar with CNs are more prone to use them in different contexts, not necessarily reproducing the distribution of types that they hear. Further investigation is planned to determine that. For future work we plan to augment the MWE annotation, since current coverage is determined by the available resources used in the annotation. Moreover cases of MWE tokens involving internal modification or a different word order not listed in the resources will also not be identified (e.g. hold right on). We also plan to do a qualitative analysis of the data and use it as basis for evaluating a computational model of language acquisition.
