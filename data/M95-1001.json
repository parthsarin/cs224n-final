MUC-6 introduced several innovation s over prior MUCs, most notably in the range of different tasks for which evaluations were conducted . We describe the development of the \"message understanding\" task over the course of the prior MUCs, som e of the motivations for the new format, and the steps which led up to the formal evaluation . ) THE MUC EVALUATION S Last fall we completed the sixth in a series of Message Understanding Conferences, which have been organized by NRAD, the RDT&E division of the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Cente r (formerly NOSC, the Naval Ocean Systems Center) with the support of DARPA, the Defense Advance d Research Projects Agency . This paper looks briefly at the history of these Conferences and then examine s the considerations which led to the structure of MUC-6 . 2 The Message Understanding Conferences were initiated by NOSC to assess and to foster research on th e automated analysis of military messages containing textual information . Although called \"conferences\" , th e distinguishing characteristic of the MUCs are not the conferences themselves, but the evaluations to whic h participants must submit in order to be permitted to attend the conference . For each MUC, participatin g groups have been given sample messages and instructions on the type of information to be extracted, an d have developed a system to process such messages . Then, shortly before the conference, participants are given a set of test messages to be run through their system (without making any changes to the system) ; the output of each participant's system is then evaluated against a manually-prepared answer key . The MUCs have helped to define a program of research and development . DARPA has a number o f information science and technology programs which are driven in large part by regular evaluations . The MUCs are notable, however, in that they have substantially shaped the research program in informatio n extraction and brought it to its current state . 3 PRIOR MUG S MUC-1 (1987) was basically exploratory ; each group designed its own format for recording the informatio n in the document, and there was no formal evaluation . By MUC-2 (1989) , the task had crystalized as one of template filling . One receives a description of a class of events to be identified in the text ; for each of thes e events one must fill a template with information about the event . The template has slots for informatio n about the event, such as the type of event, the agent, the time and place, the effect, etc . For MUC-2, the template had 10 slots . Both MUC-1 and MUC-2 involved sanitized forms of military messages about nava l sightings and engagements . The second MUC also worked out the details of the primary evaluation measures, recall and precision . To present it in simplest terms, suppose the answer key has Nkey filled slots ; and that a system fills Ncorrec t slots correctly and Nincorrect incorrectly (with some other slots possibly left unfilled) . The n Nkey Ncorrec t Ncorrect'+ Nincorrec t For MUC-3 (1991) , the task shifted to reports of terrorist events in Central and South America, as reporte d in articles provided by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, and the template became somewhat mor e complex (18 slots) . A sample MUC-3 message and template is shown in Figure 1 . This same task was use d for MUC-4 (1992) , with a further small increase in template complexity (24 slots) . For MUC-1 through 4 , all the text was in upper case . MUC-5 (1993) , which was conducted as part of the Tipster program,' represented a substantial furthe r jump in task complexity . Two tasks were involved, international joint ventures and electronic circuit fabrication, in two languages, English and Japanese . In place of a single template, the joint venture task employe d 11 object types with a total of 47 slots for the output -double the number of slots defined for MUC-4 -an d the task documentation also doubled in size to over 40 pages in length . A sample article and correspondin g template for the MUC-5 English joint venture task are shown in Figures 2 and 3 . The text shown is all upper case, but (for the first time) the test materials contained mixed-case text as well . One innovation of MUC-5 was the use of a nested structure of objects . In earlier MUCs, each event had been represented as a single template -in effect, a single record in a data base, with a large numbe r of attributes . This format proved awkward when an event had several participants (e .g ., several victims of a terrorist attack) and one wanted to record a set of facts about each participant . This sort of information could be much more easily recorded in the hierarchical structure introduced for MUC-5, in which there wa s a single object for an event, which pointed to a list of objects, one for each participant in the event . The sample template in Figure 3 illustrates several of the other features which added to the complexity of the MUC-5 task . The TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP object points to the ACTIVITY object, which in tur n points to the INDUSTRY object, which describes what the joint venture actually did . Within the INDUSTRY object, the PRODUCT/SERVICE slot has to list not just the specific product or service of the joint venture , but also a two-digit code for this product or service, based on the top-level classification of the Standar d Industrial Classification . The TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP also pointed to an OWNERSHIP object, which specified the total capitalization using standard codes for different currencies, and the percentage ownershi p of the various participants in the joint venture (which may involve some calculation, as in the example show n here) . While each individual feature of the template structure adds to the value of the extracted information , the net effect was a substantial investment by each participant in implementing the many details of the task . EFFECT ON HUMAN TARGET(S) - Figure 1 : A sample message and associated filled template from MUC-3 (terrorist domain) . Slots which are not applicable to this type of incident (a kidnapping) are marked with an ' \" . For several of these slots , there are alternative \"correct\" answers ; only one of these answers is shown here . <DOCNO> MUC-6 : INITIAL GOAL S DARPA convened a meeting of Tipster participants and government representatives in December 1993 t o define goals and tasks for MUC-6 . 5 Among the goals which were identified wer e \u2022 demonstrating domain-independent component technologies of information extraction which would b e immediately usefu l \u2022 encouraging work to make information extraction systems more portabl e \u2022 encouraging work on \" deeper understanding \" Each of these can been seen in part as a reaction to the trends in the prior MUCs . The MUC-5 tasks, i n particular, had been quite complex and a great effort had been invested by the government in preparing th e training and test data and by the participants in adapting their systems for these tasks . Most participants worked on the tasks for 6 months ; a few (the Tipster contractors) had been at work on the tasks for considerably longer . While the performance of some systems was quite impressive (the best got 57% recall, 64 % precision overall, with 73% recall and 74% precision on the 4 \"core\" object types), the question naturally arose as to whether there were many applications for which an investment of one or several developers ove r half-a-year (or more) could be justified . Furthermore, while so much effort had been expended, a large portion was specific to the particular tasks . It wasn't clear whether much progress was being made on the underlying technologies which would be neede d for better understanding . To address these goals, the meeting formulated an ambitious menu of tasks for MUC-6, with the idea that individual participants could choose a subset of these tasks . We consider the three goals in the three section s below, and describe the tasks which were developed to address each goal . SHORT-TERM SUBTASKS The first goal was to identify, from the component technologies being developed for information extraction , functions which would be of practical use, would be largely domain independent, and could in the near ter m be performed automatically with high accuracy . To meet this goal the committee developed the \"name d entity\" task, which basically involves identifying the names of all the people, organizations, and geographi c locations in a text . The final task specification, which also involved time, currency, and percentage expressions, used SGM L markup to identify the names in a text . Figure 4 shows a sample sentence with named entity annotations . The tag ENAMEX (\"entity name expression\") is used for both people and organization names ; the tag NUME X (\"numeric expression\") is used for currency and percentages . PORTABILITY The second goal was to focus on portability in the information extraction task -the ability to rapidly retarge t a system to extract information about a different class of events . The committee felt that it was important to demonstrate that useful extraction systems could be created in a few weeks . To meet this goal, we decide d that the information extraction task for MUC-6 would have to involve a relatively simple template, mor e like MUC-2 than MUC-5 ; this was dubbed \" mini-MUC\" . In keeping with the hierarchical object structure introduced in MUC-5, it was envisioned that the mini-MUC would have an event-level object pointing t o objects representing the participants in the event (people, organizations, products, etc .), mediated perhap s by a \"relational\" level object . To further increase portability, a proposal was made to standardize the lowest-level objects (for people , organizations, etc .), since these basic classes are involved in a wide variety of actions . In this way, MU C participants could develop code for these low-level objects once, and then use them with many different type s of events . These low-level objects were named \"template elements\" . As the specification finally developed, the template element for organizations had six slots, for the maxima l organization name, any aliases, the type, a descriptive noun phrase, the locale (most specific location), an d country . Slots are filled only if information is explicitly given in the text (or, in the case of the country, can be inferred from an explicit locale) . The tex t We are striving to have a strong renewed creative partnership with Coca-Cola,\" Mr . Dooner says . However, odds of that happening are slim since word from Coke headquarters in Atlanta is that . . . Ever on the lookout for additional evaluation measures, the committee decided to make the creation o f template elements for all the people and organizations in a text a separate MUC task . Like the named entity task, this was also seen as a potential demonstration of the ability of systems to perform a useful, relativel y domain independent task with near-term extraction technology (although it was recognized as being mor e difficult than named entity, since it required merging information from several places in the text) . The oldstyle MUC information extraction task, based on a description of a particular class of events (a \"scenario\" ) was called the \"scenario template\" task . A sample scenario template is shown in the appendix . MEASURES OF DEEP UNDERSTANDIN G Another concern which was noted about the MUCs is that the systems were tending towards relatively shallo w understanding techniques (based primarily on local pattern matching), and that not enough work was bein g done to build up the mechanisms needed for deeper understanding . Therefore, the committee, with strong encouragement from DARPA, included three MUC tasks which were intended to measure aspects of th e internal processing of an information extraction or language understanding system . These three tasks, which were collectively called SemEval ( \"Semantic Evaluation\") were : \u2022 Coreference : the system would have to mark coreferential noun phrases (the initial specificatio n envisioned marking set-subset, part-whole, and other relations, in addition to identity relations) \u2022 Word sense disambiguation : for each open class word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) in the text , the system would have to determine its sense using the Wordnet classification (its \"synset\", in Wordne t terminology) \u2022 Predicate-argument structure : the system would have to create a tree interrelating the constituents of the sentence, using some set of grammatical functional relation s The committee recognized that, in selecting such internal measures, it was making some presumptions regarding the structures and decisions which an analyzer should make in understanding a document . Not everyone would share these presumptions, but participants in the next MUC would be free to enter the informatio n extraction evaluation and skip some or all of these internal evaluations . Language understanding technolog y might develop in ways very different from those imagined by the committee, and these internal evaluation s might turn out to be irrelevant distractions . However, from the current perspective of most of the committee , these seemed fairly basic aspects of understanding, and so an experiment in evaluating them (and encouragin g improvement in them) would be worthwhile . PREPARATION PROCES S Round 1 : Resolution of SemEval The committee had proposed a very ambitious program of evaluations . We now had to reduce these proposal s to detailed specifications . The first step was to do some manual text annotation for the four tasksnamed entity and the SemEval triad -which were quite different from what had been tried before . Brief specifications were prepared for each task, and in the spring of 1994 a group of volunteers (mostly veterans of earlier MUCs) annotated a short newspaper article using each set of specifications . Problems arose with each of the SemEval tasks . \u2022 For coreference, there were problems identifying part-whole and set-subset relations, and distinguishin g the two (a proposal to tag more general coreference relations had been dropped earlier) ; a decision wa s later made to limit ourselves to identity relations . \u2022 For sense tagging, the annotators found that in some cases Wordnet made very fine distinctions an d that making these distinctions consistently in tagging was very difficult . \u2022 For predicate-argument structure, practically every new construct beyond simple clauses and nou n phrases raised new issues which had to be collectively resolved . Beyond these individual problems, it was felt that the menu was simply too ambitious, and that w e would do better by concentrating on one element of the SemEval triad for MUC-6 ; at a meeting held in June 1994, a decision was made to go with coreference . In part, this reflected a feeling that the problem s with the coreference specification were the most amenable to solution . It also reflected a conviction that coreference identification had been, and would remain, critical to success in information extraction, and so i t was important to encourage advances in coreference . In contrast, most extraction systems did not build ful l predicate-argument structures, and word-sense disambiguation played a relatively small role in extractio n (particularly since extraction systems operated in a narrow domain) . The coreference task, like the named entity task, was annotated using SGML notation . A COREF tag has an ID attribute which identifies the tagged noun phrase or pronoun . It may also have an attribute of the form REF=n, which indicates that this phrase is coreferential with the phrase with ID n . Figure 5 shows an excerpt from an article, annotated for coreference . 6 Round 2 : annotatio n The next step was the preparation of a substantial training corpus for the two novel tasks which remaine d (named entity and coreference) . For annotation purposes, we wanted to use texts which could be redistribute d to other sites with minimal encumbrances . We therefore selected Wall Street Journal texts from 1987, 1988 , and 1989 which had already been distributed as part of the \"ACL/DCI \" CD-ROM and which were available at nominal cost from the Linguistic Data Consortium . SRA Corporation kindly provided tools which aided in the annotation process . Again a stalwart grou p of volunteer annotators was assembled ; 7 each was provided with 25 articles from the Wall Street Journal . There was some overlap between the articles assigned, so that we could measure the consistency of annotatio n between sites . This annotation was done in the winter of 1994-95 . A major role of the annotation process was to identify and resolve problems with the task specifications . For named entities, this was relatively straightforward . For coreference, it proved remarkably difficult to formulate guidelines which were reasonably precise and consistent . 8 Round 3 : dry run Once the task specifications seemed reasonably stable, NRaD organized a \" dry run \" -a full-scale rehearsal for MUC-6, but with all results reported anonymously . The dry run took place in April 1995, with a scenario involving labor union contract negotiations, and texts which were again drawn from the 1987-89 Wall Stree t Journal . Of the sites which were involved in the annotation process, ten participated in the dry run . Results of the dry run were reported at the Tipster Phase II 12-month meeting in May 1995 . An algorithm developed by the MITRE Corporation for MUC-6 was implemented by SAIC and used fo r scoring the coreference task [4] . The algorithm compares the equivalence classes defined by the coreferenc e links in the manually-generated answer key (the \"key\") and in the system-generated output (the \"response\") . The equivalence classes are the models of the identity equivalence coreference relation .

THE FORMAL EVALUATIO N A call for participation in the MUC-6 formal evaluation was issued in June 1995 ; the formal evaluation was held in September 1995 . The scenario definition was distributed at the beginning of September ; the test dat a was distributed four weeks later, with results due by the end of the week . The scenario involved changes i n corporate executive management personnel . The texts used for the formal evaluation were drawn from the 1993 and 1994 Wall Street Journal, an d were provided through the Linguistic Data Consortium . This data had been much less exposed than th e earlier Wall Street Journal data, and so was deemed suitable for the evaluation (participants were required t o promise not to look at Wall Street Journal data from this period during the evaluation) . There had originall y been consideration given to using a more varied test corpus, drawn from several news sources . It was decided , however, that multiple sources, with different formats and text mark-up, would be yet another complicatio n for the participants at a time when they were already dealing with multiple tasks . There were evaluations for four tasks : named entity, coreference, template element, and scenario template . There were 16 participants ; 15 participated in the named entity task, 7 in coreference, 11 in template element , and 9 in scenario template . The participants, and the tasks they participated in, are listed in Figure 6 . The results of the MUC-6 evaluations are described in detail in a companion paper in this volume , \"Overview of Results of the MUC-6 Evaluation\" . Overall, the evaluation met many, though not all, of th e goals which had been set by the initial planning conference in December of 1993 . The named entity task exceeded our expectation in producing systems which could perform a relativel y simple task at levels good enough for immediate use . The nearly half the sites had recall and precision ove r 90% ; the highest-scoring system had a recall of 96% and a precision of 97% . The template element task was harder and the scores correspondingly lower than for named entit y (ranging across most systems from 65 to 75% in recall, and from 75% to 85% in precision) . There seeme d general agreement, however, that having prepared code for template elements in advance did make it easie r to port a system to a new scenario in a few weeks . The goal for scenario templates -mini-MUC -wa s to demonstrate that effective information extraction systems could be created in a few weeks . Although it i s difficult to meaningfully compare results on different scenarios, the scores obtained by most systems after a few weeks (40% to 50% recall, 60% to 70% precision) were comparable to the best scores obtained in prio r MUCs . Pushing improvements in the underlying technology was one of the goals of SemEval and its curren t survivor, coreference . Much of the energy for the current round, however, went into honing the definitio n of the task . We may hope that, once the task specification settles down, further evaluations, coupled with th e availability of coreference-annotated corpora, will encourage more work in this area . Appendix: Sample Scenario Templat e Shown below is a sample filled template for the MUC-6 scenario template task . The scenario involved change s in corporate executive management personnel . For the tex t McCann has initiated a new so-called global collaborative system, composed of world-wide accoun t directors paired with creative partners . In addition, Peter Kim was hired from WPP Group ' s J . Walter Thompson last September as vice chairman, chief strategy officer, world-wide . the following objects were to be generated : Although we cannot explain all the details of the template here, a few highlights should be noted . For eac h executive post, one generates a SUCCESSION_EVENT object, which contains references to the ORGANIZA -TION object for the organization involved, and the IN_AND_OUT object for the activity involving that pos t (if an article describes a person leaving and a person starting the same job, there will be two IN_AND_OU T objects) . The IN_AND_OUT object contains references to the objects for the PERSON and for the ORGANI-ZATION from which the person came (if he/she is starting a new job) . The PERSON and ORGANIZATIO N objects are the \"template element\" objects, which are invariant across scenarios .",
