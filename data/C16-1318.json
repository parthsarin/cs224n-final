The system assumes the hypothesis that participants in a conversation base their response not only on previous dialog utterances but also on their background knowledge. Our model is based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is trained over concatenated sequences of comments, a Convolution Neural Network that is trained over Wikipedia sentences and a formulation that couples the two trained embeddings in a multimodal space. We create a dataset of aligned Wikipedia sentences and sequences of Reddit utterances, which we we use to train our model. Given a sequence of past utterances and a set of sentences that represent the background knowledge, our end-to-end learnable model is able to generate context-sensitive and knowledge-driven responses by leveraging the alignment of two different data sources. Our approach achieves up to 55% improvement in perplexity compared to purely sequential models based on RNNs that are trained only on sequences of utterances. Introduction Over the recent years, the level of users' engagement and participation in public conversations on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook and Reddit has substantially increased. As a result, we now have large amounts of conversation data that can be used to train computer programs to be proficient conversation participants. Automatic response generation could be immediately deployable in social media as an autocomplete response suggestion feature or a conversation stimulant that adjusts the participation interest in a dialogue thread (Ritter et al., 2011) . It should also be beneficial in the development of Question-Answering systems, by enhancing their ability to generate human-like responses (Grishman, 1979) . Recent work on neural networks approaches shows their great potential at tackling a wide variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2010) . Since a conversation can be perceived as a sequence of utterances, recent systems that are employed in the automatic response generation domain are based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Sordoni et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015) , which are powerful sequence models. These systems base their generated response explicitly on a sequence of the most recent utterances of a conversation thread. Consequently, the sequence of characters, words, or comments, in a conversation, depending on the level of the model, is the only means with which these models achieve contextual-awareness, and in open-domain, realistic, situations it often proves inadequate (Vinyals and Le, 2015) . In this paper we address the challenge of context-sensitive response generation. We build a dataset that aligns knowledge from Wikipedia in the form of sentences with sequences of Reddit utterances. The dataset consists of sequences of comments and a number of Wikipedia sentences that were allocated randomly from the Wikipedia pages to which each sequence is aligned. The resultant dataset consists of \u223c 15k sequences of comments that are aligned with \u223c 75k Wikipedia sentences. We make the aligned corpus available at github.com/pvougiou/Aligning-Reddit-and-Wikipedia. We propose a novel model that leverages this alignment of two different data sources. Our architecture is based on coupling an RNN using either Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1996) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014) that processes each sequence of utterances word-by-word, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that extracts features from each set of sentences that corresponds to this sequence of utterances. We pre-train the CNN component (Kim, 2014) on a subset of the retrieved Wikipedia sentences in order to learn filters that are able to classify a sentence based on its referred topic. Our model assumes the hypothesis that each participant in a conversation bases their response not only on previous dialog utterances but also on their individual background knowledge. We use Wikipedia 1 as the source of our model's knowledge background and align Wikipedia pages and sequences of comments from Reddit 2 based on a predefined topic of discussion. Our work is inspired by recent developments in the generation of textual summaries from visual data (Socher et al., 2014; Karpathy and Li, 2014) . Our core insight stems from the idea that a system that is able to learn how to couple information from aligned datasets in order to produce a meaningful response, would be able to capture the context of a given conversation more accurately. Our model achieves up to 55% improved perplexity compared to purely sequential equivalents. It should also be noted that our approach is domain independent; thus, it could be transferred out-of-box to a wide variety of conversation topics. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses premises of our work regarding both automatic response generation and neural networks approaches for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Section 3 presents the components of the network. Section 4 describes the structure of the dataset. Section 5 discusses the experiments and the evaluation of the models. Section 6 summarises the contributions of the current work and outlines future plans. Related Work Since Bengio's introduction of neural networks in statistical language modelling (Bengio et al., 2003 ) and Mikolov's demonstration of the extreme effectiveness of RNNs for sequence modelling (Mikolov et al., 2010) , neural-network-based implementations have been employed for a wide variety of NLP tasks. In order to sidestep the exploding and vanishing gradients training problem of RNNs (Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2012) , multi-gated RNN variants, such as the GRU (Cho et al., 2014) and the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1996) , have been proposed. Both GRUs and LSTMs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for many generative tasks, such as SMT (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014) , text (Graves, 2013) and image generation (Gregor et al., 2015) . Despite the fact that CNNs had been originally employed in the computer vision domain (LeCun et al., 1998) , models based on the combination of the convolution operation with the classical Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN) (Waibel et al., 1989) have proved effective on many NLP tasks, such as semantic parsing (Yih et al., 2014) , Part-Of-Speech Tagging (POS) and Chunking (Collobert and Weston, 2008) . Furthermore, sentence-level CNNs have been used in sentiment analysis and question type identification (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014) . The concept of a system capable of participating in human-computer conversations was initially proposed by Weizenbaum (Weizenbaum, 1966) . Weizenbaum implemented ELIZA, a keyword-based program that set the basis for all the descendant chatterbots. In the years that followed, many template-based approaches (Isbell et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2003; Shaikh et al., 2010) have been suggested in the scientific literature, as a way of transforming the computer into a proficient conversation participant. However, these approaches usually adopt variants of the nearest-neighbour method to facilitate their response generation process from a number of limited sentence paradigms and, as a result, they are limited to specific topics or scenarios of conversation. Recently, models for Statistical Machine Translation have been used to generate short-length responses to a conversational incentive from Twitter utterances (Ritter et al., 2011) . In the recent literature, RNNs have been used as the fundamental component of conversational response systems (Sordoni et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015) . Even though these systems exhibited significant improvements over SMT-based methods (Ritter et al., 2011) , they either adopt the length-restricted-messages paradigm or are trained on idealised dataset that undermines the generation of responses in open domain realistic scenarios. We propose a novel architecture for context-sensitive response generation. Our model is trained on a dataset that consists of realistic sequences of Reddit comments that aligned with sets of Wikipedia sentences. We use an RNN and a CNN components to process the sequence of comments and their corresponding set of sentences respectively and we introduce a learnable coupling formulation. The coupling formulation is inspired by the Multimodal RNN that generates textual description from visual data (Karpathy and Li, 2014) . However, unlike Karpathy's approach, we do not allow the feature that is generated by the CNN component to diminish between distant timesteps (i.e. Section 3.3). Our Model Our task is to generate a context-sensitive response to a sequence of comments by incorporating background knowledge. The proposed model is based on the assumption that each participant in a conversation phrases their responses by taking into consideration both the past dialog utterances and their individual knowledge background. We train the model on a set of M sequences of Reddit comments and N summaries of Wikipedia pages that are related to the main discussed topic of a conversation. During training our models takes as an input a sequence of one-hot 3 vector representations of words x 1 , x 2 , ..., x T from a sequence of comments and a group of sentences S that is aligned with this sequence of utterances. We use a sentence-level CNN, which processes the group of sentences, in parallel with a word-level RNN that processes the sequence of comments in batches and propose a formulation that learns to couple the two networks to produce a meaningful response to the preceding comments. We experiment with two different commonly used RNN variants that are based on: (i) the LSTM cell and (ii) the GRU. We pre-train our CNN sentence model on a subset of the Wikipedia-sentences dataset in order for it to learn to classify a sentence based on the topic-keyword that was matched for its corresponding page acquisition. Please note that since bias terms can be included in each weight-matrix multiplication (Bishop, 1995) , they are not explicitly displayed in the equations that describe the models of this section. Sentence Modelling Models based on CNNs achieve their basic functionality by convolving a sequence of inputs with a set of filters in order to extract local features. We adopt the Convolutional Sentence Model from (Kim, 2014) and we expand it in order to meet our specific needs for a multi-class, rather than binary classification. Let t 1:l the concatenation of the vectors of all the words that exist in a sentence s. A narrow type convolution operation with a filter m \u2208 R k\u00d7m is applied to each m-gram in the sentence s in order to produce a feature map c mf \u2208 R l\u2212m+1 of features: c mf j = tanh(m T t j\u2212m+1:j ) , (1) c mf = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 c mf 1 . . . c mf 3 \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb , (2) with l \u2265 m. Shorter sentences are padded with zero vectors when necessary. The most relevant feature from each feature map is captured by applying the max-over-time pooling operation (Collobert and Weston, 2008) . The consequent matrix is the result of concatenating the max values from each feature map that has been produced by applying an f number of m length filters over the sentence s. The network results in a fully-connected layer and a sof tmax that carries out the classification of the sentences. The architecture of the sentence model is illustrated on the left side of Figure 1 . Sequence Modelling We describe two commonly used RNN variants that are based on: (i) the LSTM cell and (ii) the GRU. We experiment with both of them in order to explore which one serves better the sequential-modelling needs of our full architecture. Let h l t \u2208 R n be the aggregated output of a hidden unit at timestep t = 1...T and layer depth l = 1...L. The vectors at zero layer depth, h 0 t = W x\u2192h x t , represent vectors that are given to the network as an input. The parameter matrix W x\u2192h has dimensions [|X|, n] , where |X| is the cardinality of all the potential one-hot input vectors. All the matrices that follow have dimension [n, n]. Long Short-Term Memory Our LSTM cells' architecture is adopted from (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2014) : in l t = sigm(W l in h l\u22121 t + W l h\u2192in h l t\u22121 ) , (3) f l t = sigm(W l f h l\u22121 t + W l h\u2192f h l t\u22121 ) , ( 4 ) cell l t = f l t cell l t\u22121 + in l t tanh(W l cell h l\u22121 t + W l h\u2192cell h l t\u22121 ) , ( 5 ) out l t = sigm(W l out h l\u22121 t + W l h\u2192out h l t\u22121 ) , (6) h l t = out l t tanh(cell l t ) , (7) where in l t , f l t , out l t and cell l t are the vectors at timestep t and layer depth l that correspond to the input gate, the forget gate, the output gate and the cell respectively. Gated Recurrent Unit The Gated Recurrent Unit was proposed as a less-complex implementation of the LSTM (Cho et al., 2014) . reset l t = sigm(W l reset h l\u22121 t + W l h\u2192reset h l t\u22121 ) , (8) update l t = sigm(W l update h l\u22121 t + W l h\u2192update h l t\u22121 ) , (9) h l t = tanh(W l in h l\u22121 t + W l h\u2192h (reset l t h l t\u22121 )) , (10) h l t = (1 \u2212 update l t ) h l t\u22121 + update l t h l t , (11) where reset l t , update l t and h l t are the vectors at timestep t and layer depth l that represent the values of the reset gate, the update gate and the hidden candidate respectively. Coupling After the pre-training of the CNN is complete, and the fully-connected and sof tmax layers are removed, the CNN is connected to the hidden units of the last layer L of the recurrent component. This is illustrated in Figure 1 . The recurrent component is implemented with either LSTMs or GRUs. At each timestep, the RNN is processing a word from a sequence of comments and the CNN is extracting local features by convolving this sequence's corresponding sentences with groups of differently sized filters. The redcoloured edges in Figure 1 represent the learnable parameters during training. The coupling formulation that follows is inspired by the Multimodal RNN that generates textual description from visual data (Karpathy et al., 2014) . Since, we do not want to allow the effect of sentence features, which represent the background knowledge of our model, to diminish between distant timesteps we differentiate from Karpathy's approach; and instead of providing the feature that is generated by the CNN to the RNN only at the first timestep, we provide it at every timestep. Furthermore, Karpathy employs the simple RNN or Elman network (Elman, 1990) as the sequence modelling component of his architecture whereas we adopt multi-gated RNN variants. It should be noted that in the equations that follow, the term CN N h \u2208 R MF would refer to the output of the sentence-level CNN with its fully-connected and sof tmax layers disconnected, where MF is the group of all the feature maps that are generated for each different filter size. During training the resultant embeddings, which are computed by the CN N h processing a group of sentences S and the RNN variant processing the sequence of one-hot input word vectors x 1 , x 2 , ..., x T from the corresponding sequence of comments, are coupled in a hidden state h 1 , h 2 , ..., h T . The prediction for the next word is computed by projecting this hidden state h t to sequence of outputs y 1 , y 2 , ..., y T : c S = W c\u2192h CN N h (S) , (12) h t = h L t c S , (13) y t = sof tmax(W y h t ). ( 14 ) 4 Dataset We create a dataset 4 of aligned sentences from Wikipedia and sequences of utterances from Reddit. A shared, fixed, vocabulary was used for both data sources. We treat Wikipedia as a \"cleaner\" data source and we formed our vocabulary in the following manner. First, we included all the words that occur 2 or more times in the Wikipedia sentences. Subsequently, from the Reddit sequences of comments, we included any words that occur at least 3 times across both data sources. The resultant shared dictionary includes 56280 of the most frequent words. Every out-of-vocabulary word is represented by a special NaN token. In constructing our dataset, our goal is to align Wikipedia sentences with sequences of comments from Reddit. We found that topics related to philosophy and literature are discussed on Reddit with the exchange of longer and more elaborative messages than the responses of the majority of conversational subjects on social media. A dataset that consists of long and detailed responses would provide more room for conversation incentives and would allow us to investigate the performance of our architectures against dialog exchanges with longer comments. We compiled a list of 35 predetermined topic-keywords from the philosophical and literary domain. By utilising the search feature of both the Reddit API 5 and the MediaWiki API 6 , we extracted: (i) sequences of comments from conversational threads most related to each keyword and (ii) the 300 Wikipedia pages most related to each keyword after carrying out Wikipedia's automatic disambiguation procedure. In order to increase the homogeneity of the dataset in terms of the length of both the sequences of comments and the sentences, we excluded sequences and sentences whose length exceeded: (i) len \u2212 \u03c3 = 1140 and (ii) len \u2212 2 \u2022 \u03c3 = 54 words respectively. The resultant dataset consists of 15460 sequences of Reddit comments and 75100 Wikipedia sentences. Reddit Reddit is absolved from the length-restricted-messages paradigm, facilitating the generation of longer and more meaningful responses. Furthermore, Reddit serves as an openly-available question-answering platform. Our research hypothesis is that a neural network trained on sequences of questions and their corresponding answers will be able to generate responses that escape the concept of daily-routine expressions, such as \"good luck\" or \"have fun\", and facilitate a playground for more detailed and descriptive dialogue utterances. Each different conversation on Reddit starts with a user submitting a parent-comment on a subreddit. A sequence of utterances then succeeds this parent comment. Since we wanted to investigate how our model performs against long-term dependant dialog components, we set the depth of conversation to 5. Starting from the parent-comment, we follow the direction of the un-ordered tree of utterances until the fourth-level child-comment. If a comment (node) leads to n responses (children), we copy the observed sequence n times and for each sequence, we continue until the fourth response (leaf). Based on the above structural paradigm, we extracted sequences with at least four children-comments, of which we retained the only first four utterances along with the original parent-comment of the sequence. Note that each comment in a sequence is augmented with the respective start-of-comment <start> and end-ofcomment <end> tokens. Minimalism is about reducing the interference of the information with the users sense-making process. An error, in fact, is the teachable moment that the content can exploit. Table 1 : Example of the alignment of our dataset. One sequence of comments is coupled with a set of sentences. The sentences are randomly allocated from the Wikipedia pages which have been extracted based on the same search term (Noam Chomsky) as the corresponding sequence. Wikipedia Wikipedia sentences are used as the knowledge background of our model. We chose to include only sentences from the Wikipedia summaries, since in preliminary experiments, we found that including all the textual material of a page introduces a lot of noise to our data. The 13410 Wikipedia summaries that matched the search criteria were split into sentences. Each sentence was labelled with the initial topickeyword that was matched for its corresponding page acquisition. A subset of 30000 labelled sentences was used for pre-training the CNN component of our architecture. Dataset Alignment We choose to align each sequence of Reddit utterances with 20 Wikipedia sentences. Both the Wikipedia pages to which the sentences correspond and the sequence of comments have been extracted using the same search-term. An example of the structure of the dataset is displayed in Table 1 . Experiments The full network was regularised by introducing a dropout (Zaremba et al., 2014) value of 0.4 to the non-recurrent connections between the last hidden state, h t , and the softmax layer of the network. In order to avoid any potential exploding gradients training problems, we enforce an l 2 constraint on the gradients of the weights in order for them to be no greater than 5 (Sutskever et al., 2014) . \u2022 The CNN component is trained with narrow convolutional filters of widths 3, 4, 5 and 6, with 300 feature maps each. We use the rectifier as activation function. All of the parameters were initialised with a random uniform distribution between \u22120.1 and 0.1. The network was trained for 10 epochs using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.2. We regularised the network by introducing a dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) value of 0.7 to the connections between the pooling and the softmax layer of the network. \u2022 For the recurrent component of our networks, we use 2 layers of (i) 1000 LSTM cells and (ii) 1000 GRUs, resulting in approximately 16M and 12M recurrent connections respectively. All of the parameters are initialised with a random uniform distribution between \u22120.08 and 0.08. The networks were trained for 10 epochs, using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.5. After the 7th epoch in the LSTM case and 3rd epoch in the GRU case, the learning rate was decayed by 0.2 every half epoch. The dataset is split into training, validation and test with respective portions of 80, 10 and 10. A sample of responses that is generated by our proposed systems is shown in Table 2 . Experimental Results Examples of responses that are generated by our proposed systems and their respective purely sequential equivalents are shown in Table 2 . The sequences of comments and their corresponding sentences are sampled randomly from the test set. Our architectures learn to couple information that exists in the sequence of comments with knowledge that is contained in the Wikipedia sentences and is, potentially, related to context of those comments. When a piece of information in the sequence of comments is successfully aligned with the content of its corresponding Wikipedia sentences a knowledgeable, context-sensitive response is generated. A representative example of this functionality is provided in the last sequence of comments in Table 2 , where the context of the sequence is coupled with the fact that Chomsky supported Bernie Sanders in the United States presidential election (i.e. from the allocated to that sequence of Reddit utterances Wikipedia sentence: \"In late 2015, Chomsky announced his support for Vermont U.S. senator Bernie Sanders in the upcoming 2016 United States presidential election.\" 7 ). In case no information alignment is identified between the content of the sequence of comments and the Wikipedia sentences, the generation procedure is based almost explicitly on the sequence of utterances, and a response is generated in a similar to the purely sequential models' fashion. Automatic Evaluation We use perplexity on the test set to evaluate our proposed models against their purely sequential equivalents. Perplexity measures the cross-entropy between the predicted sequence of words and the actual, empirical, sequence of words. The results are illustrated in the top part of Table 3 . Our proposed architectures achieve 55% and 45% improvement in perplexity compared to their respective purely LSTMand GRU-based equivalents. Human Evaluation Human evaluation was conducted using research students and staff from the School of Electronics and Computer Science of the University of Southampton. The evaluators were provided with a table of 10 randomly selected sequences of Reddit comments along with the response that is generated by our proposed models and their purely sequential equivalents. In order to simplify our task, we included only sequences of comments with a length less than 100 words. The name of the models to which each response corresponds were anonymised. The authors excluded themselves from this evaluation procedure. The evaluators were asked to rate each generated response from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating a very bad response, based on how well it fits the context of the corresponding sequence of comments. Table 3 presents the average rating of each model's responses based on human evaluation. Even though our decision to apply a restriction over the length of the sequences of utterances, which were included in the human evaluation experiment, brings us in an agreement with literature that challenges the reliability of automatic evaluation methods, such as perplexity, in the domain of short-length responses (Ritter et al., 2011) , we argue that an experiment at a larger scale, absolved from significant simplification choices, would demonstrate an alignment between the human judgements and the automatic evaluation results. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge this work constitutes the first attempt for building an end-to-end learnable system for automatic context-sensitive response generation by leveraging the alignment of two different data sources. We proposed a novel system that incorporates background knowledge in order to capture the context of a conversation and generate a meaningful response. This paper made the following contributions: We built a dataset that aligns knowledge from Wikipedia in the form of sentences with sequences of Reddit utterances; and, we designed a neural network architecture that learns to couple information from different types of textual data in order to capture the context of a conversation and generate a meaningful response. Our approach achieved up to 55% improvement in perplexity compared to purely sequential models based on RNNs that are trained only on sequences of utterances. It should also be noted that despite the fact that our dataset focuses on the philosophical and literary domain, the design procedure could be transferred out-of-the-box to a great variety of domains. Arguments could be made against the performance gain of our architectures against human evaluation. Based on the reported low performance of purely LSTM-based models on very long-term dependant datasets (Sutskever et al., 2014) , we believe that an experiment at a larger scale without a restriction over the length of the sequences of utterances (Section 5.3) would emphasise the superiority of our approach. We believe that further work on the coupling formulation that is proposed in Section 3.3 could provide additional improvements to the results of this work. An additional direction for future work could be the introduction of a complimentary, to the current procedure, task that would enhance the quality of the information alignment from the two data sources.
