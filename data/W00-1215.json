Compared with others, this scheme can fully differentiate those Chinese phrases that comprise the same content words but hold different meanings due to their different word order or some involved function words, and capture the hierarchical conceptual structure of Chinese phrases, which underlies their main semantic information. We also give the guidelines for annotating various commonly used types of Chinese phrases. Introduction Semantically annotated linguistic data are important resources for natural language processing, and have been used in many NLP areas, e.g., parsing, word sense disambiguation, co-reference resolution and information extraction, etc. But due to huge efforts needed in building them and general difficulties in dealing with semantic information, such resources are scarcely seen for most languages including Chinese, if not all. In this paper, we focus on Chinese phrases and present a recursive graph based scheme for their semantic annotation. Compared with the same task for sentences, it only involves a relatively small data set and simple semantic information but has potential generality and application. One is at which goal the annotation is aimed. In our case, the goal is established to be to help disclose the correspondence between linguistic forms and meaning, which is also the primary goal in both traditional linguistic research (Chomsky, 1968 ) and natural language understanding (Allen, 1995) . The other problem is whether the annotation can significantly contribute to the established goal. In our case, the answer is of course positive. First, the phrases themselves are a specific kind of linguistic forms, thus their semantic annotation directly provides the correspondence between them and their meanings. Second, by some kinds of analogy rules, these annotated phrases can be examples for deriving the correspondence between new phrases and their meanings. Third, as compared with western languages, Chinese language has a specific feature that its sentences form in roughly the same way as its phrases (Zhu, 1982) , which shows that by some kinds of combinatory rules, the mapping between sentences and their meanings can also be determined based on the examples. The remainder of this paper is organised as the following. In section 2, we describe the motivation of introducing recursive graph. In section 3, we formally define what is a recursive graph. In section 4, we specify how commonly used types of Chinese phrases are annotated using recursive graph. In section 5, we give the conclusion and discuss some future work. Motivation As a specific semantic annotation task, two problems should be made clear at first. In general, semantic annotation of linguistic forms is to associate with them their semantic information being represented in some formal languages or diagrams. With the semantic information involved varying, the formal languages or diagrams may be different. One commonly used diagram for semantic annotation of linguistic forms is dependent tree, in which the dependence or control relationship between constituents of a linguistic form is depicted (Langacker, 1997) . But such trees may be not powerful enough to differentiate those Chinese phrases that comprise the same content words but hold different meanings due to their word order or involved function words. As an example, consider 1) and 2) 1. 1) /zousi/ /qiche/ smuggle car 2) /qiche/ /zousi/ car smuggle Notice 1) and 2) contain the same content words, but hold different word order. Regarding their meanings, 1) is an ambiguous phrase, corresponding with two English translation phrases as 3) and 4). 3) to smuggle cars 4) smuggled cars The translation phrase for 2) is 5). 5) the smuggling of cars So, there are altogether three meanings held by the two phrases. But the two content words can only form two dependent trees, listed in 6) and 7). 1 In this paper, whenever listing a Chinese word, we always list its Pinyin included within two symbols 7', and its English translation. For a Chinese phrase, we furthermore list its English translation when necessary. 6) ~ (/qiche/, car) t ~L(/zousi/, smuggle) 7) ;~ ~ (/zousi/, smuggle) t (/qich , car) Obviously, these two dependent trees cannot code the three meanings listed in 3), 4) and 5). Only if we could see the same word ;~1~ ~L(/zousi/, smuggle) semantically different in 1) and 2), we could add another dependent tree 8) to code 5), with 6) and 7) corresponding with 3) and 4) respectively. 8) j~t~ ~L'(/zousi/, smuggle) 2 t ~ :~i~: (Iqichel, car) But this view is quite unintuitive, and will lead to contradictory. Consider other two phrases 9) and 10). 9) /zousi/ /jituan/ smuggle bloc smuggling bloc 10) /qiche/ /zousi/ /jituan/ car smuggle bloc car smuggling bloc Intuitively, the word :~l~/L(/zousi/, smuggle) in 2) holds the same meaning as the word in 10), which subsequently is equivalent with the same word in 9). On the other hand, there is no reason to treat the same word ~L (/zousi/, smuggle) semantically differently in 1) and 9), two typical noun phrases. Particularly, they are both followed by a typical noun in the two phrases. The second problem for dependent tree to semantically annotate linguistic forms is that due to its tree nature, it cannot represent multi-dependence relationship, in which one node is controlled by several nodes. For example, consider 11). 11) /xihuan/ /ziji/ /de/ /ren/ like self of people the people who like oneself Conventionally, its dependent tree should be 12). 12) ~ (/ren/, people) gX (/xihuan/, like) ~ (/ziji/, self) But intuitively, there should be some dependence relationship between )k(/ren/, people) and fl ~ (/ziji/, self). If we add this relationship, it will become a graph. Conceptual Graph Conceptual graph is another diagram for semantic annotation of linguistic forms, which comprises concepts and conceptual relationship denoted by linguistic forms (Eklund, 1996) . Although it is claimed to be a directed graph in its original form, it is equivalent to an undirected graph in nature, with its relationship nodes and their directed edges replaced with an undirected edge to directly denote the relationship. One problem with this diagram for semantic annotation is that it cannot code the information about head, if any, in a linguistic form, which intuitively specifies the main information carried by a linguistic form. This will lead to severe problems when using the graph to represent linguistic forms. For example, both phrases 1) and 2) with all three meanings 3), 4) and 5) would be represented by the same diagram as in 13) 3 . 13) ~/~ ~:~ (/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car) To differentiate the three meanings held by the two phrases, we suggest using the following two weighted graphs and one unweighted graph, i.e., 14), 15) and 16) to represent 3), 4) and 5) respectively. 20, But there will be no appropriate annotation for 18), because on the one hand, ~(/qiche/,car) should be coded as a head due to its relationship with ~g~(/piaoliang/, beautiful), on the other hand, it's role as the object of the verb ~L(/zousi/, smuggle) makes it illegal to be a head. To differentiate 17) and 18), we further suggest specifying the embedded structures in linguistic forms in some way, and use circles to denote them. In such opinion, 17) can be annotated as 21) and 22) respectively. 21) ~ In this diagram, the smaller rectangle denotes the head of the modifier-center phrase ~$/L~ (/zousiqiche/, smuggled cars), the circle codes the phrase as an embedded structure of the whole phrase, while bigger rectangle denotes the head of the whole phrase. 22) :xT~ ~L~ In this diagram, the circle denotes the embedded structure $~,;~~(/piaofiang de qiche/, beautiful cars), while the rectangle denotes the head of the embedded structure. Notice the phrase on the whole is a verb phrase, so there is no head coded here. Recursive Graph One major concern for semantic annotation of linguistic forms is what semantic information will be coded, or more generally, what is their semantic information, which has long been a quite controversial question. From the point of view of concepts, linguistic forms including phrases semantically refer to concepts, which we think generally fall within four categories: a) preliminary concept. For example, we may see the word tl/~(/wu/, thing) denotes a prefiminary concept. b) compositional concept or situtm'on, which consists of some concepts and their relation 4. For example, phrase 1) with the meaning 3) denotes a situation including the concepts the two content words, :i~l~L(/zousi/, smuggle) and ~(/qiche/, car), denote respectively, and their relationship, ~llJ{:(/shoushi/, patient). 4 relation is also a specific kind of concopts, e.g., ~$(/shoushi/, patient) is a relation between ~L(/zousi/, smuggle) and ~(/qicheJ, car). c) subordinate concept or specific concept within a situation, for example, phrase 1) with the meaning 4) refers to the concept denoted by ~(/qiche/, car) in the situation mentioned in b). Notice that the concepts within one situation themselves may be compositional concepts, subordinate concepts or subordinate features, so the concepts that linguistic forms including phrases denote generally presents a kind of hierarchical structure. In fact, this hierarchical structure in return represents the main semantic information of linguistic forms. We introduce recursive graph as formal diagram to represent the hierarchical structure of linguistic forms. Let Po be the set of preliminary points, we call pc Po a Olevel graph. Suppose Pi~-Po, Ei(~-Po) is the set of the edges between points in P1, Ri(~(PlX El)) is the set of relations between points in PI and edges in Et s, then: s Here, Edges are also points. An edge point connecting two other points here equals an edge in a traditional definition of graph. i) <P1, El, Ri> is a I-level compositional graph ; ii) <<Pi, El, R~>, p> (peP9 is a 1- level point-headed graph; iii) <<P1, El, R/>, e> (e~E1) is a 1- level edge-headed graph; iv) 1-level concepts comprise 1-1evel compositional graphs, l-level point-headed graphs, and 1-level edge-headed graphs. Let ,_o=Po, Zn-1 be the set of (n-1)-leveI graphs, suppose Pn~(,.ouZiu .... ,Za4), (PnnXn.1)\u00a2NIL, En(C-Pn) is the set of the edges between points in P~, Rn(C(P=x En)) is the set of relations between points in P= and edges in En, then: v) vi) vii) viii) <P~, E~, Rn> is a n-level compositional graph; <<en, En, Rn>, p> (P~Pn) is a n- level point-headed graph; <<P~, E~, Rn>, e> (e~En) is a nlevel edge-headed graph; n-level concepts comprise n-level compositional graphs, n-level point-headed graphs, and n-level edge-headed graphs. Intuitively, O-level graph corresponds with preliminary points, compositional graph corresponds with situation, point-headed graph corresponds with subordinate concept, and edge-headed graph corresponds with subordinate feature. Annotation Guidelines In general, Chinese phrases can roughly be classified into five categories, i.e., subpredicate, verb-object, modifier-center, verbcomplement, and coordinate. We give some examples in the following for each category. Sub-predicate In general, the phrase :in this category denotes a compositional concept. For example, 24) can be annotated as 25). Intuitively, the concept the word Jti!i~l~(/guniang/, girl) denotes has a feature, ~t'~ (/waimao/, appearance), and its value is ~(/piaoliang/, beautiful). In other words, there exists a relationship, i.e., ~l'~(/waimao/, appearance), between the two concepts denoted by ~rdi~l~(/guniang/, girl) and ~-~ (/piaoliang/, beautiful) respectively 6. Verb-object Similar with sub-predicate phrases, the phrase in this category also denotes a compositional concept. Phrase 1) with the meaning 3) is an example, and can be annotated as 26). 26) ~$~ ~ Intuitively, there exists a relationship, i.e., ~l:(/shoushi/, patient), between the two concepts denoted by ;~t~L (/zousi/, smuggle) and ~ (/qiche/, car) respectively. Modifier-center The phrase in this category generally denotes a subordinate concept. The center here in the phrase can be a verb, a noun or an adjective. As examples, 27) and 28) are annotated as 29) and 30). 27) 28) / I Intuitively, the concept denoted by ~t(/guniang/, girl) has a feature ~b~ (/waimao/, appearance), which is the head of this phrase. Verb-complement For the phrase in this category, the semantic relationship between its two parts, i.e., verb and complement, is very complicated (Ma, 1987) ; even there is no direct semantic links between them sometimes. Consider 32) and 33). 32) /chi/ /bao/ eat full. to eat and be full 33) ~ 't~ /pao/ /kuai/ run fast to run fast In 32), {~(/bao/, full) has a direct link with the agent of ~(/chi/, eat), in which sense the two concepts denoted by ~[g(/bao/, full) and ~(/chi/, eat) has no direct semantic link. We don't consider such phrases in our annotation temporarily. In contrast, in 33), 'I~(/kuai/, fast) acts as the value of one feature :~.~(/sudu/, speed) of ~(/pao/, run), in which sense it has a direct semantic link with ~\u00a2~(/pao/, run). They form a subordinate concept, annotated as 34). 34) ~-q '[~ Coordinate In general, the phrase in this category denotes a compositional concept. As an example, consider 35). 35) /shi/ /sheng/ teacher student teacher and student Intuitively, there is a relationship, i.e., 9-f (/bing/, and), between the two concepts denoted by the two words. So, it can be annotated as 36). 36) ~ 5 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we propose a recursive graph based scheme for semantic annotation of Chinese phrases. This scheme can fully differentiate those Chinese phrases that comprise the same content words but with different meaning due to their different word order or some involved function words. It can also capture the hierarchical conceptual structures of Chinese phrases, which determine their main semantic information. Now, we have annotated about 5,000 Chinese phrases using this scheme. One methodological issue is that we also choose multi-character Chinese words as candidate annotation phrases. The reason is that unlike western languages, there is no clear-cut between words and phrases in Chinese, for most multi-character Chinese words, their components may also be words, and the meaning of the multi-character words tends to be strongly related with that of their component words. In this sense, the words can be treated as basic phrases. More importantly, such basic annotation examples can be more complete in the sense of coverage. Future work will extend to 50,000 Chinese phrases. Another future work is to learn the rules that dete~ne the mapping between linguistic forms and meanings based on this annotation, and apply the rules to new phrases and sentences. If this can be successful, we can develop a semantic analyzer for Chinese without any syntactic analysis. In particular, we can avoid part-ofspeeches or syntactic structures that have long been difficult notions for Chinese languages. insightful discussions, and the anonymous reviewers for their comments.
