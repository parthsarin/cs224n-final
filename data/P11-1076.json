We combine several graph alignment features with lexical semantic similarity measures using machine learning techniques and show that the student answers can be more accurately graded than if the semantic measures were used in isolation. We also present a first attempt to align the dependency graphs of the student and the instructor answers in order to make use of a structural component in the automatic grading of student answers. Introduction One of the most important aspects of the learning process is the assessment of the knowledge acquired by the learner. In a typical classroom assessment (e.g., an exam, assignment or quiz), an instructor or a grader provides students with feedback on their answers to questions related to the subject matter. However, in certain scenarios, such as a number of sites worldwide with limited teacher availability, online learning environments, and individual or group study sessions done outside of class, an instructor may not be readily available. In these instances, students still need some assessment of their knowledge of the subject, and so, we must turn to computerassisted assessment (CAA). While some forms of CAA do not require sophisticated text understanding (e.g., multiple choice or true/false questions can be easily graded by a system if the correct solution is available), there are also student answers made up of free text that may require textual analysis. Research to date has concentrated on two subtasks of CAA: grading essay responses, which includes checking the style, grammaticality, and coherence of the essay (Higgins et al., 2004) , and the assessment of short student answers (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003; Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005; Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009) , which is the focus of this work. An automatic short answer grading system is one that automatically assigns a grade to an answer provided by a student, usually by comparing it to one or more correct answers. Note that this is different from the related tasks of paraphrase detection and textual entailment, since a common requirement in student answer grading is to provide a grade on a certain scale rather than make a simple yes/no decision. In this paper, we explore the possibility of improving upon existing bag-of-words (BOW) approaches to short answer grading by utilizing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, in an attempt to mirror the ability of humans to understand structural (e.g. syntactic) differences between sentences, we employ a rudimentary dependency-graph alignment module, similar to those more commonly used in the textual entailment community. Specifically, we seek answers to the following questions. First, to what extent can machine learning be leveraged to improve upon existing approaches to short answer grading. Second, does the dependency parse structure of a text provide clues that can be exploited to improve upon existing BOW methodologies? Related Work Several state-of-the-art short answer grading systems (Sukkarieh et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2002) require manually crafted patterns which, if matched, indicate that a question has been answered correctly. If an annotated corpus is available, these patterns can be supplemented by learning additional patterns semi-automatically. The Oxford-UCLES system (Sukkarieh et al., 2004) bootstraps patterns by starting with a set of keywords and synonyms and searching through windows of a text for new patterns. A later implementation of the Oxford-UCLES system (Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005) compares several machine learning techniques, including inductive logic programming, decision tree learning, and Bayesian learning, to the earlier pattern matching approach, with encouraging results. C-Rater (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003) matches the syntactical features of a student response (i.e., subject, object, and verb) to that of a set of correct responses. This method specifically disregards the BOW approach to take into account the difference between \"dog bites man\" and \"man bites dog\" while still trying to detect changes in voice (i.e., \"the man was bitten by the dog\"). Another short answer grading system, AutoTutor (Wiemer-Hastings et al., 1999) , has been designed as an immersive tutoring environment with a graphical \"talking head\" and speech recognition to improve the overall experience for students. AutoTutor eschews the pattern-based approach entirely in favor of a BOW LSA approach (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) . Later work on AutoTutor (Wiemer-Hastings et al., 2005; Malatesta et al., 2002) seeks to expand upon their BOW approach which becomes less useful as causality (and thus word order) becomes more important. A text similarity approach was taken in (Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009) , where a grade is assigned based on a measure of relatedness between the student and the instructor answer. Several measures are compared, including knowledge-based and corpusbased measures, with the best results being obtained with a corpus-based measure using Wikipedia combined with a \"relevance feedback\" approach that iteratively augments the instructor answer by integrating the student answers that receive the highest grades. In the dependency-based classification component of the Intelligent Tutoring System (Nielsen et al., 2009) , instructor answers are parsed, enhanced, and manually converted into a set of content-bearing dependency triples or facets. For each facet of the instructor answer each student's answer is labelled to indicate whether it has addressed that facet and whether or not the answer was contradictory. The system uses a decision tree trained on part-of-speech tags, dependency types, word count, and other features to attempt to learn how best to classify an answer/facet pair. Closely related to the task of short answer grading is the task of textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2005) , which targets the identification of a directional inferential relation between texts. Given a pair of two texts as input, typically referred to as text and hypothesis, a textual entailment system automatically finds if the hypothesis is entailed by the text. In particular, the entailment-related works that are most similar to our own are the graph matching techniques proposed by Haghighi et al. (2005) and Rus et al. (2007) . Both input texts are converted into a graph by using the dependency relations obtained from a parser. Next, a matching score is calculated, by combining separate vertex-and edge-matching scores. The vertex matching functions use wordlevel lexical and semantic features to determine the quality of the match while the the edge matching functions take into account the types of relations and the difference in lengths between the aligned paths. Following the same line of work in the textual entailment world are (Raina et al., 2005) , (MacCartney et al., 2006 ), (de Marneffe et al., 2007) , and (Chambers et al., 2007) , which experiment variously with using diverse knowledge sources, using a perceptron to learn alignment decisions, and exploiting natural logic. Answer Grading System We use a set of syntax-aware graph alignment features in a three-stage pipelined approach to short answer grading, as outlined in Figure 1 . In the first stage (Section 3.1), the system is provided with the dependency graphs for each pair of instructor (A i ) and student (A s ) answers. For each node in the instructor's dependency graph, we compute a similarity score for each node in the student's dependency graph based upon a set of lexical, semantic, and syntactic features applied to both the pair of nodes and their corresponding subgraphs. The scoring function is trained on a small set of manually aligned graphs using the averaged perceptron algorithm. In the second stage (Section 3.2), the node similarity scores calculated in the previous stage are used to weight the edges in a bipartite graph representing the nodes in A i on one side and the nodes in A s on the other. We then apply the Hungarian algorithm to find both an optimal matching and the score associated with such a matching. In this stage, we also introduce question demoting in an attempt to reduce the advantage of parroting back words provided in the question. In the final stage (Section 3.4), we produce an overall grade based upon the alignment scores found in the previous stage as well as the results of several semantic BOW similarity measures (Section 3.3). Using each of these as features, we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to produce a combined realnumber grade. Finally, we build an Isotonic Regression (IR) model to transform our output scores onto the original [0,5] scale for ease of comparison. Node to Node Matching Dependency graphs for both the student and instructor answers are generated using the Stanford Dependency Parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006) in collapse/propagate mode. The graphs are further post-processed to propagate dependencies across the \"APPOS\" (apposition) relation, to explicitly encode negation, part-of-speech, and sentence ID within each node, and to add an overarching ROOT node governing the main verb or predicate of each sentence of an answer. The final representation is a list of (relation,governor,dependent) triples, where governor and dependent are both tokens described by the tuple (sentenceID:token:POS:wordPosition). For example: (nsubj, 1:provide:VBZ:4, 1:program:NN:3) indicates that the noun \"program\" is a subject in sentence 1 whose associated verb is \"provide.\" If we consider the dependency graphs output by the Stanford parser as directed (minimally cyclic) graphs, 1 we can define for each node x a set of nodes N x that are reachable from x using a subset of the relations (i.e., edge types) 2 . We variously define \"reachable\" in four ways to create four subgraphs defined for each node. These are as follows: \u2022 N 0 x : All edge types may be followed \u2022 N 1 x : All edge types except for subject types, ADVCL, PURPCL, APPOS, PARATAXIS, ABBREV, TMOD, and CONJ \u2022 N 2 x : All edge types except for those in N 1 x plus object/complement types, PREP, and RCMOD \u2022 N 3 x : No edge types may be followed (This set is the single starting node x) Subgraph similarity (as opposed to simple node similarity) is a means to escape the rigidity involved in aligning parse trees while making use of as much of the sentence structure as possible. Humans intuitively make use of modifiers, predicates, and subordinate clauses in determining that two sentence entities are similar. For instance, the entity-describing phrase \"men who put out fires\" matches well with \"firemen,\" but the words \"men\" and \"firemen\" have less inherent similarity. It remains to be determined how much of a node's subgraph will positively enrich its semantics. In addition to the complete N 0 x subgraph, we chose to include N 1 x and N 2 x as tightening the scope of the subtree by first removing more abstract relations, then sightly more concrete relations. We define a total of 68 features to be used to train our machine learning system to compute node-node (more specifically, subgraph-subgraph) matches. Of these, 36 are based upon the semantic similarity of four subgraphs defined by N [0..3] x . All eight WordNet-based similarity measures listed in Section 3.3 plus the LSA model are used to produce these features. The remaining 32 features are lexicosyntactic features 3 defined only for N 3 x and are described in more detail in Table 2 . We use \u03c6(x i , x s ) to denote the feature vector associated with a pair of nodes x i , x s , where x i is a node from the instructor answer A i and x s is a node from the student answer A s . A matching score can then be computed for any pair x i , x s \u2208 A i \u00d7 A s through a linear scoring function f (x i , x s ) = w T \u03c6(x i , x s ). In order to learn the parameter vector w, we use the averaged version of the perceptron algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1999; Collins, 2002) . As training data, we randomly select a subset of the student answers in such a way that our set was roughly balanced between good scores, mediocre scores, and poor scores. We then manually annotate each node pair x i , x s as matching, i.e. A(x i , x s ) = +1, or not matching, i.e. A(x i , x s ) = \u22121. Overall, 32 student answers in response to 21 questions with a total of 7303 node pairs (656 matches, 6647 nonmatches) are manually annotated. The pseudocode for the learning algorithm is shown in Table 1 . After training the perceptron, these 32 student answers are removed from the dataset, not used as training further along in the pipeline, and are not included in the final results. After training for 50 epochs, 4 the matching score f (x i , x s ) is calculated (and cached) for each node-node pair across all student answers for all assignments. 0. set w \u2190 0, w \u2190 0, n \u2190 0 1. repeat for T epochs: 2. foreach A i ; A s : 3. foreach x i , x s \u2208 A i \u00d7 A s : 4. if sgn(w T \u03c6(x i , x s )) = sgn(A(x i , x s )): 5. set w \u2190 w + A(x i , x s )\u03c6(x i , x s ) 6. set w \u2190 w + w, n \u2190 n + 1 7. return w/n. Graph to Graph Alignment Once a score has been computed for each node-node pair across all student/instructor answer pairs, we attempt to find an optimal alignment for the answer pair. We begin with a bipartite graph where each node in the student answer is represented by a node on the left side of the bipartite graph and each node in the instructor answer is represented by a node on the right side. The score associated with each edge is the score computed for each node-node pair in the previous stage. The bipartite graph is then augmented by adding dummy nodes to both sides which are allowed to match any node with a score of zero. An optimal alignment between the two graphs is then computed efficiently using the Hungarian algorithm. Note that this results in an optimal matching, not a mapping, so that an individual node is associated with at most one node in the other answer. At this stage we also compute several alignmentbased scores by applying various transformations to the input graphs, the node matching function, and the alignment score itself. The first and simplest transformation involves the normalization of the alignment score. While there are several possible ways to normalize a matching such that longer answers do not unjustly receive higher scores, we opted to simply divide the total alignment score by the number of nodes in the instructor answer. The second transformation scales the node matching score by multiplying it with the idf 5 of the instructor answer node, i.e., replace f (x i , x s ) with idf (x i ) * f (x i , x s ). The third transformation relies upon a certain real-world intuition associated with grading student Table 2 : Subtree matching features used to train the perceptron answers -repeating words in the question is easy and is not necessarily an indication of student understanding. With this in mind, we remove any words in the question from both the instructor answer and the student answer. In all, the application of the three transformations leads to eight different transform combinations, and therefore eight different alignment scores. For a given answer pair (A i , A s ), we assemble the eight graph alignment scores into a feature vector \u03c8 G (A i , A s ). Haghighi et al. (2005) , working on the entailment detection problem, point out that finding a good alignment is not sufficient to determine that the aligned texts are in fact entailing. For instance, two identical sentences in which an adjective from one is replaced by its antonym will have very similar structures (which indicates a good alignment). However, the sentences will have opposite meanings. Further information is necessary to arrive at an appropriate score. Lexical Semantic Similarity In order to address this, we combine the graph alignment scores, which encode syntactic knowledge, with the scores obtained from semantic similarity measures. Following Mihalcea et al. (2006) and Mohler and Mihalcea (2009) , we use eight knowledgebased measures of semantic similarity: shortest path [PATH], Leacock & Chodorow (1998) [LCH], Lesk (1986) , Wu & Palmer(1994) [WUP], Resnik (1995) [RES], Lin (1998), Jiang & Conrath (1997) [JCN], Hirst & St. Onge (1998) [HSO], and two corpusbased measures: Latent Semantic Analysis [LSA] (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and Explicit Seman-tic Analysis [ESA] (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) . Briefly, for the knowledge-based measures, we use the maximum semantic similarity -for each open-class word -that can be obtained by pairing it up with individual open-class words in the second input text. We base our implementation on the WordNet::Similarity package provided by Pedersen et al. (2004) . For the corpus-based measures, we create a vector for each answer by summing the vectors associated with each word in the answer -ignoring stopwords. We produce a score in the range [0..1] based upon the cosine similarity between the student and instructor answer vectors. The LSA model used in these experiments was built by training Infomap 6 on a subset of Wikipedia articles that contain one or more common computer science terms. Since ESA uses Wikipedia article associations as vector features, it was trained using a full Wikipedia dump. Answer Ranking and Grading We combine the alignment scores \u03c8 G (A i , A s ) with the scores \u03c8 B (A i , A s ) from the lexical semantic similarity measures into a single feature vector \u03c8(A i , A s ) = [\u03c8 G (A i , A s )|\u03c8 B (A i , A s )] . The feature vector \u03c8 G (A i , A s ) contains the eight alignment scores found by applying the three transformations in the graph alignment stage. The feature vector \u03c8 B (A i , A s ) consists of eleven semantic featuresthe eight knowledge-based features plus LSA, ESA and a vector consisting only of tf*idf weights -both with and without question demoting. Thus, the entire feature vector \u03c8(A i , A s ) contains a total of 30 features. An input pair (A i , A s ) is then associated with a grade g(A i , A s ) = u T \u03c8(A i , A s ) computed as a linear combination of features. The weight vector u is trained to optimize performance in two scenarios: Regression: An SVM model for regression (SVR) is trained using as target function the grades assigned by the instructors. We use the libSVM 7 implementation of SVR, with tuned parameters. Ranking: An SVM model for ranking (SVMRank) is trained using as ranking pairs all pairs of student answers (A s , A t ) such that grade(A i , A s ) > grade(A i , A t ), where A i is the corresponding instructor answer. We use the SVMLight 8 implementation of SVMRank with tuned parameters. In both cases, the parameters are tuned using a grid-search. At each grid point, the training data is partitioned into 5 folds which are used to train a temporary SVM model with the given parameters. The regression passage selects the grid point with the minimal mean square error (MSE), and the SVM-Rank package tries to minimize the number of discordant pairs. The parameters found are then used to score the test set -a set not used in the grid training. Isotonic Regression Since the end result of any grading system is to give a student feedback on their answers, we need to ensure that the system's final score has some meaning. With this in mind, we use isotonic regression (Zadrozny and Elkan, 2002) to convert the system scores onto the same [0..5] scale used by the annotators. This has the added benefit of making the system output more directly related to the annotated grade, which makes it possible to report root mean square error in addition to correlation. We train the isotonic regression model on each type of system output (i.e., alignment scores, SVM output, BOW scores). Data Set To evaluate our method for short answer grading, we created a data set of questions from introductory computer science assignments with answers provided by a class of undergraduate students. The assignments were administered as part of a Data Struc-tures course at the University of North Texas. For each assignment, the student answers were collected via an online learning environment. The students submitted answers to 80 questions spread across ten assignments and two examinations. 9 Table 3 shows two question-answer pairs with three sample student answers each. Thirty-one students were enrolled in the class and submitted answers to these assignments. The data set we work with consists of a total of 2273 student answers. This is less than the expected 31 \u00d7 80 = 2480 as some students did not submit answers for a few assignments. In addition, the student answers used to train the perceptron are removed from the pipeline after the perceptron training stage. The answers were independently graded by two human judges, using an integer scale from 0 (completely incorrect) to 5 (perfect answer). Both human judges were graduate students in the computer science department; one (grader1) was the teaching assistant assigned to the Data Structures class, while the other (grader2) is one of the authors of this paper. We treat the average grade of the two annotators as the gold standard against which we compare our system output. The annotators were given no explicit instructions on how to assign grades other than the [0..5] scale. Both annotators gave the same grade 57.7% of the time and gave a grade only 1 point apart 22.9% of the time. The full breakdown can be seen in Table 4 . In addition, an analysis of the grading patterns indicate that the two graders operated off of different grading policies where one grader (grader1) was more generous than the other. In fact, when the two differed, grader1 gave the higher grade 76.6% of the time. The average grade given by grader1 is 4.43, Sample questions, correct answers, and student answers Grades Question: What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving? Correct answer: To simulate the behavior of portions of the desired software product. Student answer 1: A prototype program is used in problem solving to collect data for the problem. 1, 2 Student answer 2: It simulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product. 5, 5 Student answer 3: To find problem and errors in a program before it is finalized. 2, 2 Question: What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming? Correct answer: Abstraction and reusability. Student answer 1: They make it easier to reuse and adapt previously written code and they separate complex programs into smaller, easier to understand classes. 5, 4 Student answer 2: Object oriented programming allows programmers to use an object with classes that can be changed and manipulated while not affecting the entire object at once. 1, 1 Student answer 3: Reusable components, Extensibility, Maintainability, it reduces large problems into smaller more manageable problems. 4, 4 Table 3 : A sample question with short answers provided by students and the grades assigned by the two human judges while the average grade given by grader2 is 3.94. The dataset is biased towards correct answers. We believe all of these issues correctly mirror real-world issues associated with the task of grading. Results We independently test two components of our overall grading system: the node alignment detection scores found by training the perceptron, and the overall grades produced in the final stage. For the alignment detection, we report the precision, recall, and F-measure associated with correctly detecting matches. For the grading stage, we report a single Pearson's correlation coefficient tracking the annotator grades (average of the two annotators) and the output score of each system. In addition, we report the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the full dataset as well as the median RMSE across each individual question. This is to give an indication of the performance of the system for grading a single question in isolation. 10 Perceptron Alignment For the purpose of this experiment, the scores associated with a given node-node matching are converted into a simple yes/no matching decision where positive scores are considered a match and negative scores a non-match. The threshold weight learned from the bias feature strongly influences the point at which real scores change from non-matches to matches, and given the threshold weight learned by the algorithm, we find an F-measure of 0.72, with precision(P) = 0.85 and recall(R) = 0.62. However, as the perceptron is designed to minimize error rate, this may not reflect an optimal objective when seeking to detect matches. By manually varying the threshold, we find a maximum F-measure of 0.76, with P=0.79 and R=0.74. Figure 2 shows the full precision-recall curve with the F-measure overlaid. Question Demoting One surprise while building this system was the consistency with which the novel technique of question demoting improved scores for the BOW similarity measures. With this relatively minor change the average correlation between the BOW methods' sim-ilarity scores and the student grades improved by up to 0.046 with an average improvement of 0.019 across all eleven semantic features. Table 5 shows the results of applying question demoting to our semantic features. When comparing scores using RMSE, the difference is less consistent, yielding an average improvement of 0.002. However, for one measure (tf*idf), the improvement is 0.063 which brings its RMSE score close to the lowest of all BOW metrics. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. As a baseline, we include here the results of assigning the average grade (as determined on the training data) for each question. The average grade was chosen as it minimizes the RMSE on the training data. Alignment Score Grading Before applying any machine learning techniques, we first test the quality of the eight graph alignment features \u03c8 G (A i , A s ) independently. Results indicate that the basic alignment score performs comparably to most BOW approaches. The introduction of idf weighting seems to degrade performance somewhat, while introducing question demoting causes the correlation with the grader to increase while increasing RMSE somewhat. The four normalized components of \u03c8 G (A i , A s ) are reported in Table 6 . SVM Score Grading The SVM components of the system are run on the full dataset using a 12-fold cross validation. Each of the 10 assignments and 2 examinations (for a total of 12 folds) is scored independently with ten of the remaining eleven used to train the machine learn- ing system. For each fold, one additional fold is held out for later use in the development of an isotonic regression model (see Figure 3 ). The parameters (for cost C and tube width \u01eb) were found using a grid search. At each point on the grid, the data from the ten training folds was partitioned into 5 sets which were scored according to the current parameters. SVMRank and SVR sought to minimize the number of discordant pairs and the mean absolute error, respectively. Both SVM models are trained using a linear kernel. 11 Results from both the SVR and the SVMRank implementations are reported in Table 7 along with a selection of other measures. Note that the RMSE score is computed after performing isotonic regression on the SVMRank results, but that it was unnecessary to perform an isotonic regression on the SVR results as the system was trained to produce a score on the correct scale. We report the results of running the systems on three subsets of features \u03c8(A i , A s ): BOW features \u03c8 B (A i , A s ) only, alignment features \u03c8 G (A i , A s ) only, or the full feature vector (labeled \"Hybrid\"). Finally, three subsets of the alignment features are used: only unnormalized features, only normalized features, or the full alignment feature set.  Table 7 : The results of the SVM models trained on the full suite of BOW measures, the alignment scores, and the hybrid model. The terms \"normalized\", \"unnormalized\", and \"both\" indicate which subset of the 8 alignment features were used to train the SVM model. For ease of comparison, we include in both sections the scores for the IAA, the \"Average grade\" baseline, and two of the top performing BOW metrics -both with question demoting. Discussion and Conclusions There are three things that we can learn from these experiments. First, we can see from the results that several systems appear better when evaluating on a correlation measure like Pearson's \u03c1, while others appear better when analyzing error rate. The SVM-Rank system seemed to outperform the SVR system when measuring correlation, however the SVR system clearly had a minimal RMSE. This is likely due to the different objective function in the corresponding optimization formulations: while the ranking model attempts to ensure a correct ordering between the grades, the regression model seeks to minimize an error objective that is closer to the RMSE. It is difficult to claim that either system is superior. Likewise, perhaps the most unexpected result of this work is the differing analyses of the simple tf*idf measure -originally included only as a baseline. Evaluating with a correlative measure yields predictably poor results, but evaluating the error rate indicates that it is comparable to (or better than) the more intelligent BOW metrics. One explanation for this result is that the skewed nature of this \"natural\" dataset favors systems that tend towards scores in the 4 to 4.5 range. In fact, 46% of the scores output by the tf*idf measure (after IR) were within the 4 to 4.5 range and only 6% were below 3.5. Testing on a more balanced dataset, this tendency to fit to the average would be less advantageous. Second, the supervised learning techniques are clearly able to leverage multiple BOW measures to yield improvements over individual BOW metrics. The correlation for the BOW-only SVM model for SVMRank improved upon the best BOW feature from .462 to .480. Likewise, using the BOW-only SVM model for SVR reduces the RMSE by .022 overall compared to the best BOW feature. Third, the rudimentary alignment features we have introduced here are not sufficient to act as a standalone grading system. However, even with a very primitive attempt at alignment detection, we show that it is possible to improve upon grade learning systems that only consider BOW features. The correlations associated with the hybrid systems (esp. those using normalized alignment data) frequently show an improvement over the BOW-only SVM systems. This is true for both SVM systems when considering either evaluation metric. Future work will concentrate on improving the quality of the answer alignments by training a model to directly output graph-to-graph alignments. This learning approach will allow the use of more complex alignment features, for example features that are defined on pairs of aligned edges or on larger subtrees in the two input graphs. Furthermore, given an alignment, we can define several phrase-level grammatical features such as negation, modality, tense, person, number, or gender, which make better use of the alignment itself.
