We provide details for the most important features of the platform, as well as elaborate typical MT system training workflows for client-specific MT solution development. Introduction Today, as globalisation and cross-border trade infuse more sectors of the economy, the need for translations and multilingual content is continuously increasing. The demand for translations is surpassing the supply that professional translation services can handle. As Common Sense Advisory reported in a 2016 market study, \"enterprises intend to increase their translation volumes by 67% over current levels by 2020.\" (Lommel and DePalma, 2016) An obvious alternative to customers who cannot afford professional translation services or who have too much content to translate, and also an obvious choice for translation and localisation service providers who see the potential in increasing their productivity, is machine translation (MT). General MT providers (such as Google 1 and Microsoft 2 ) cater for the masses with general-domain MT systems. However, customers who require purpose-built and highly customised MT systems, particular for complex or low-resourced languages, turn to MT service providers that offer MT system development and customization capabilities as a fullservice package. One such custom MT platform is Tilde MT 3 , the successor of the LetsMT! platform (Vasil \u00b8jevs et al., 2012) for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system development, first launched in 2012. Tilde MT builds upon the LetsMT! platform by providing greater customisation capabilities, smarter data processing workflows, and current state-ofthe-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system support. The paper is further structured as follows: Section 2. provides an overview of the main features of the Tilde MT platform, Section 3. describes the MT system training workflow with the different tools used for data processing, Section 4. describes the MT system translation workflow, and Section 5. concludes the paper. Overview of Tilde MT Tilde MT is a cloud-based custom MT platform that allows users to store linguistic resources (such as paral-lel and monolingual corpora and multilingual term collections); train SMT and NMT systems; integrate the systems through computer assisted translation (CAT) tool plugins or the Tilde MT external API in users' translation and multilingual content creation workflows; and perform translation of text snippets, documents of various popular formats, and websites directly in the Tilde MT graphical user interface or using a widget that can be integrated in any website. SMT and NMT System Support Tilde MT supports two MT paradigms: statistical machine translation and neural machine translation. The platform allows to train Moses phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn et al., 2007) and attention-based encoder-decoder NMT systems with multiplicative long short-term memory units using the Nematus toolkit (Sennrich et al., 2017) . The platform has been designed to allow switching to different NMT engines easily. For translation, Nematus NMT models are converted to Marian (formerly AmuNMT) NMT models (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2016) that allow reaching much higher translation speed (up to 10 times faster compared to Nematus in non-batched translation scenarios). Cloud-based Infrastructure To facilitate on-demand training and deployment of MT systems, it is important for the platform to be highly scalable, available, and reliable. To address these requirements, Tilde MT has been developed as a distributed cloud-based platform (see Figure 1 ) that is able to dynamically start and turn off computing nodes depending on current workloads. The computing nodes are responsible for running MT system training tasks and translation servers. To provide MT services also to customers with security concerns or customers whose data is not allowed to leave the customers' infrastructure, Tilde MT can be also deployed as an enterprise solution in customer infrastructure. Tilde Data Library The platform features a resource-rich data repository, the Tilde Data Library. The library is used as the central data repository for Tilde MT, as well as an open facility for registered users to upload their own corpora (both parallel and Several of the largest (publicly available) parallel corpora in the Tilde Data Library are the DGT-TM (Steinberger et al., 2012) , Tilde MODEL (Rozis and Skadin \u00b8\u0161, 2017) , Open Subtitles (Tiedemann, 2009) , MultiUN (Chen and Eisele, 2012) , DCEP (Hajlaoui et al., 2014) , JRC-Acquis (Steinberger et al., 2006) , Europarl (Koehn, 2005) , Microsoft Translation Memories and UI Strings Glossaries (Microsoft, 2015) . The Tilde Data Library stores approximately 12.35 billion parallel segments for 58 languages and over 4 million terms for more than 125 languages. Tilde Terminology Integration Term collections are important linguistic resources that are often used by translators who work on domain-specific translation tasks. To alleviate the need for users to store and manage their terminological resources on multiple platforms, the Tilde MT platform allows users to access their Tilde Terminology (Pinnis et al., 2013) resources. Users can add their term collections to MT system training tasks for static terminology integration as well as to running SMT 4 systems for dynamic terminology integration (Pinnis, 2015). Integration of terminology has been shown to improve term translation accuracy by up to 52.6% (Pinnis, 2015) . 4 For NMT systems, dynamic integration is not yet available. CAT Tool Plugins and External API Professional translators often use specific computerassisted translation tools in their professional duties. Depending on specific projects or customers, translators may have to use different CAT tools. Therefore, it is crucial to the success of an MT platform to provide integration capabilities for at least the most popular CAT tools. MT systems trained on Tilde MT can be accessed from at least four popular CAT tools 5 : MateCat (Federico et al., 2014) , SDL Trados Studio, Memsource 6 , and memoQ 7 . MT System Training Workflow Tilde MT provides users with rich customisation possibilities when training MT systems. Users can specify which filtering and cleaning steps to take, which data pre-processing tools to use, and which MT models and with which configurations to train. Further, we describe in more detail the main MT system training capabilities of Tilde MT. Data Filtering and Cleaning Not all data that users upload in the Tilde Data Library as parallel data is actually parallel. For instance, the data may contain misalignment issues, formatting issues, encoding corruption issues, sentence breaking issues, etc. Therefore, the Tilde MT platform performs data filtering before MT system training. The following issues are addressed by various filters in Tilde MT: 1. Source-source or target-target entries in parallel data (equal source/target entries are filtered out). 2. Sentence splitting issues (segments >1000 symbols or >400 tokens are filtered out; the numerical thresholds here and further can be adjusted for each individual training task). 3. Data corruption through optical character recognition (OCR), e.g., when processing PDF documents (segments containing tokens with >50 symbols are filtered out). 4. Redundancy issues (duplicate entries are filtered out). 5. Partial translation (also sentence splitting) issues (entries where the length ratio between the source and target segments is too small (e.g., <0.3) are filtered out). 6. Foreign language data issues (entries containing letters from neither source nor target languages are filtered out). 7. Sentence misalignment issues (sentences failing a cross-lingual alignment test using c-eval (Zarin \u00b8a et al., 2015) are filtered out). In our previous research, we identified that NMT systems are sensitive to systematic noise that can be found in the parallel data (Pinnis et al., 2017a) . Therefore, additionally to the filters used for SMT systems, for NMT systems Tilde MT performs also the following filtering steps to ensure that the parallel corpora are filtered more strictly (Pinnis et al., 2017c) : 1. Incorrect language filtering using a language detection tool (Shuyo, 2010) . 2. Low content overlap filtering using the cross-lingual alignment tool MPAligner (Pinnis, 2013) . 3. Digit mismatch filtering, which showed to be effective in identifying parallel corpora sentence segmentation issues. After filtering, each valid segment is cleaned in order to further reduce noise and to remove potential non-translatable text fragments, which will be processed by the formatting tag handling method in the translation workflow prior to decoding but are not necessary during training. The following are the main cleaning steps: 1. Removal of HTML and XML tags, 2. Removal of the byte order mark 3. Removal of escaped characters (e.g., \"\\n\") 4. Decoding of XML entities, normalisation of whitespace characters 5. Removal of empty braces and curly tags (specific to parallel corpora extracted from some CAT tools) 6. Separation of ligatures into letters (specific to parallel corpora extracted using OCR methods) Data Pre-processing Next, the filtered and cleaned corpora are pre-processed using standard and custom tools. This step is identical for both the training and translation workflows. The following pre-processing steps are performed: 1. Normalisation of punctuation. Tilde MT allows limiting MT models to one standard of quotation marks and apostrophes. 2. Identification of terminology. For SMT systems, dynamic terminology integration support ensures that terms can be identified in the source text and possible translation equivalents can be provided to the SMT engine before the actual translation. 3. Identification of non-translatable entities. E-mail addresses, URLs, file addresses and XML tags can be identified and replaced with place-holders. 4. Tokenisation. Tilde MT uses a regular expressionbased tokeniser that allows applying customised tokenisation rules for each language and customer. 5. Truecasing. The standard Moses truecasing tool truecase.perl can be used to truecase the first or all words of each sentence. 6. Morphology-driven word splitting (MWS) (Pinnis et al., 2017b) or byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2015) . For NMT systems, tokens can be split using a morphological analyser 8 and processed with BPE. 7. Source side factorisation. Tilde MT supports NMT models that use linguistic input features (Sennrich and Haddow, 2016) . Therefore, the source side can be factored using language-specific factorisation tools (depending on the source language -either part-of-speech or morphological taggers or syntactic parsers). SMT and NMT Model Training After the data is pre-processed, SMT or NMT models are trained. During configuration of an MT system, users can freely select whether to train an SMT or an NMT model. For SMT models, word alignment is performed using fastalign (Dyer et al., 2013) , after which a 7-gram translation and the wbe-msd-bidirectional-fe-allff 9 reordering models are built. For language modelling, the KenLM (Heafield, 2011) toolkit is used (the n-gram order can be specified by the users). SMT systems are tuned using MERT (Bertoldi et al., 2009) . For NMT models, training data is further pre-processed by introducing unknown phenomena (i.e., unknown word tokens) within training data following the methodology by Pinnis et al. (2017b) . Then, an NMT model is trained using the configuration specified by the user (e.g., the vocabulary size, embedding and hidden layer dimensions, whether to use dropout, the learning rate, gradient clipping, etc. parameters can be freely configured). To ensure the stability of the system, a maximum value restriction is applied for each configuration parameter that influences the hardware resources to be consumed. Translation Workflow When an MT model is trained, a translation server can be started. A typical translation server (see Figure 2 for a broad overview) allows to translate text snippets, translation segments (i.e., content that includes tags), documents (e.g., various OpenDocument 10 and Office Open XML 11 formats, translation and localisation formats, such as XML Localisation Interchange File Format (XLIFF) 12  (with different variations), Translation Memory eXchange (TMX) 13 , etc.), and web sites (the latter two basically consist of zero to many translation segments). When translating translation segments, first, formatting tags are removed from the segments and the tag positions are remembered for reinsertion after translation. Then, the text is pre-processed using the same steps that were used for the training data. Additionally to the previous preprocessing steps, the text is also split into sentences (before (Pinnis et al., 2017c) . Each pre-processed sentence is then translated using the MT engine that was used during training. After translation, unknown word tokens are replaced back with their source language tokens, the text is recased and detokenised using language-specific detokenisation rules. Tilde MT provides also functionality for rule-based localisation, i.e., the transformation of certain types of tokens according to customer specified localisation rules. For instance, a customer can pre-set the desired styles of quotation marks and apostrophes, number formats (i.e., decimal point and thousand separators), even conversion rules for different units of measurement (e.g., imperial to metric units, etc.). Finally, if the source was a translation segment, formatting tags are re-inserted in the translated text and (in case of document and Web page translation) the translated segment is inserted in the final document. INPUT In order for the whole translation workflow to work, it is important to keep track of word and phrase alignments and the changes of the word and phrase alignments at each step. When using SMT models, the word alignments are provided by the phrase-based translation model, and when using NMT models, the word alignments are extracted (Pinnis et al., 2017c) from the alignment matrices produced by the attention mechanism of the NMT model. To address scalability requirements, Tilde MT allows starting multiple translation server instances of each MT system. To save computing resources, translation servers can be set to fall asleep after a certain time without any translation requests. Conclusion In this paper, we presented Tilde MT, a distributed cloudbased custom machine translation platform that is capable of supporting SMT and NMT systems. Tilde MT with its feature-rich MT system training workflow alleviates a lot of manual work necessary for data preparation prior to training. The workflows have been specifically adjusted to cater for NMT system, which are more sensitive to systematic noise, development. The platform also allows training more robust NMT models by preparing data in a way that it contains unknown phenomena in common contexts. We also described the translation workflow and its abilities to handle unknown phenomena and to facilitate customer specific customisation needs. Finally, we briefly discussed also the various integration possibilities offered by Tilde MT, such as the CAT tool plugins, the external API, and the Tilde Terminology integration).
