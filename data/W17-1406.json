Introduction In syntactic parsing and the field of data-driven natural language processing in general, there has been a growing tendency to harmonize the numerous annotations schemes, developed for linguistic annotation of individual languages or specific language resources, that have prevented direct comparisons of annotated data and the performance of the resultant NLP tools. To overcome this heterogeneity inhibiting both theoretical and engineering advancements in the field, the Universal Dependencies 1 annotation scheme provides a universal inventory of morphological and syntactic categories and guidelines for their application, while also allowing for language-specific extensions, when necessary (Nivre, 2015) . The scheme is based on previous similar standardization projects (Marneffe et al., 2014; Petrov et al., 2012; Zeman, 2008) , and has recently been substantially modified to its second version (UD v2), following five successive releases of treebanks pertaining to UD v1 (Nivre et al., 2016) . In 1 http://universaldependencies.org/ the v2.0 release 2 , 72 treebanks for 47 different languages have been released, including the reference (written) Slovenian UD Treebank, set forward in the remainder of this paper. Dependency Treebanks for Slovenian The Slovenian UD Treebank represents the third generation of syntactically annotated corpora in Slovenian. The first was the Slovene Dependency Treebank (D\u017eeroski et al., 2006) , based on the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) annotation scheme (Haji\u010dov\u00e1 et al., 1999) and consisting of approximately 30,000 tokens taken from the Slovenian component of the parallel MULTEXT-East corpus (Erjavec, 2012) , i.e., the Slovenian translation of the novel \"1984\" by George Orwell. As the PDT's scheme for analytical layer proved to be too complex given the financial and temporal constraints of subsequent projects, a new, simplified syntactic annotation scheme was developed within the JOS project (Erjavec et al., 2010) . Within this scheme, the syntactic annotation layer consists of only 10 dependency relations, following the general assumption that specific syntactic constructions can be retrieved by combining these labels with the underlying word-level morphosyntactic descriptions (MSDs), wherein the JOS MSD tagset 3 is identical to the tagset defined in the MULTEXT-East Version 4 morphosyntactic specifications for Slovene (Erjavec, 2012) . The JOS annotation scheme was first applied to the jos100k corpus (Erjavec et al., 2010) consisting of approximately 100,000 tokens, sampled from the FidaPLUS reference corpus of written Slovene (Arhar and Gorjanc, 2007) , and later extended to a larger sample of additional 400,000 tokens in the Communication in Slovene (SSJ) project, 4 released as the ssj500k training corpus, with the latest version being v1.4 (Krek et al., 2015) . The corpus is manually annotated with MSDs and lemmas but, due to financial constrains, only approximately one half (235,000) of the tokens were annotated on the syntactic layer. This subcorpus, known as the ssj200k treebank, currently represents the largest and the most representative collection of manually syntactically annotated data in Slovenian. It has been used in the development of several data-driven annotation tools (Gr\u010dar et al., 2012; Dobrovoljc et al., 2012; Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Erjavec, 2016) and was chosen as the basis 5 for the construction of the Slovenian UD Treebank, using the conversion process described below. Conversion from JOS to UD To maintain a long-term compatibility between the two resources and maximize the level of consistency, the ssj200k conversion from JOS to UD annotation scheme was designed as a completely automatic procedure. Due to several discrepancies between the two annotation schemes, however, numerous conversion rules have been compiled on both morphological and syntactic level, whereas the tokenization, sentence segmentation and lemmatization principles of the original ssj200k treebank (currently) remain unchanged. In particular, we haven't used the option where tokens containing several (syntactic) words can be decomposed; this remains as future work. Mapping of Morphosyntax In terms of POS categorization, UD introduces a more fine-grained tagset of 17 POS categories in comparison with 12 POS categories in JOS, as it distinguishes between different types of (JOS-defined) verbs (AUX vs. VERB), conjunctions (CCONJ vs. SCONJ), characters (SYM vs. PUNCT), on the one hand, and subsumes the JOS Abbreviation POS as part of the X UD POS, on the other. A particularly challenging new category is the determiner (DET), reserved for nominal modifiers expressing the reference of the noun phrase in context, not traditionally used in Slavic grammars. For its conversion, a lexicon-oriented approach was adopted, in which pronominal subcategories in JOS were classified as either DET or PRON based on their typical syntactic behavior and their inflectional features, regardless of their context-specific syntactic role (Figure 1 ). Thus, predominantly pro-adjectival sub-categories (e.g. possessive or demonstrative pronouns) were converted to DET, while pro-nominal (e.g., personal pronouns) remained annotated as PRON, with lemmas in some sub-categories distributed between both POS categories (e.g., the JOS indefinite pronouns nekdo.PRON \"somebody\" vs. mnog.DET \"many\"). Similarly, a pre-determined list of indefinite quantifiers (e.g., nekaj \"some\", ve\u010d \"more\", veliko \"a-lot\"), annotated as adverbs in JOS, has also been converted to DET. For the Slovenian UD Treebank 22 morphological features have been adopted, among which four are language-(Gender[psor], Number[psor], i.e., gender and number of the possessor with possessive adjectives) or treebankspecific (NumForm, Variant). In addition to the features not expressed morphologically in Slovenian (Evident), or not identifiable using automatic procedures (Polite), the Slovenian Treebank currently also lacks the universal Voice feature, as no morphological distinction has been made between predicative and attributive uses of participles in the JOS annotation scheme (e.g., ukradena denarnica \"a stolen wallet\" vs. denarnica je bila ukradena \"the wallet was stolen\"). The morphological layer conversion from JOS to UD is performed by a script which uses two semi-ordered tables (one for mapping the POS and the other for features). In total, the POS mapping contains 107 rules, of which 22 simply map a combination of the JOS POS and features to an UD POS, while 85 also specify the lemma of the token. There is only one rule that also takes into account the syntactic relation of the token, namely that for mapping an JOS auxiliary verb to the UD AUX or VERB. The feature mapping table contains 106 rules, of which 85 map a combination of the JOS POS and features, and possibly the already mapped UD POS to a UD feature, and 21 which are lemma-dependent. Mapping of Syntax Although both the JOS and the UD annotation scheme are based on the dependency grammar theory and adopt similar principles regarding the primacy of content words over function words, there are several significant differences between the two frameworks. Most notably, the UD annotation scheme introduces a much broader scope of syntactic analysis in comparison with JOS, where priority was given to parsing of predicates and their valency arguments, whereas semantically 'peripheral' sentence elements, such as sentence adverbs, discourse particles, interjections, vocatives, apposition, punctuation, clausal coordination, juxtaposition, etc. did not receive any syntactic analysis in JOS (as exemplified in Figure 2 ). Secondly, the UD scheme also incorporates a much more detailed set of dependency relations (37 universal labels) than JOS (10 labels), as illustrated by the example given in Figure 3 , in which the JOS Atr relation, intended for annotation of any head-modifier relation in a nominal phrase, converts to various types of nominal dependents in UD, such as different types of modifiers (amod, nmod, nummord, advmod, det, acl). In the same way, no distinction is made in JOS regarding the different syntactic structures of the dependents, whereas UD differentiates between nominal (nsubj, obj/iobj, obl) and clausal (csubj, ccomp, advcl) dependents performing the same syntactic role (see, for example, the two annotations of JOS Obj in Figure 2 ). On the other hand, some semantic information is lost when converting data from JOS to UD, as JOS distinguishes between different types of arguments given their semantic role, such as between different types of adverbials or between semantically (non-)obligatory prepositional phrases, whereas UD only adopts the distinction between core arguments (i.e., subjects, objects, clausal complements) on the one hand, and oblique modifiers on the other, regardless of the degree of their obligatoriness in terms of valency and semantics. In addition to categorization differences, the principles for determining the head-dependant direction mostly remain the same, with the exception of some specific constructions and the copula relation, in which the copula is dependent on the nonverbal predicate (see the cop relation in Figures 2  and 3 ). In total, 32 different dependency relations have been used in the Slovenian UD treebank, including three extensions, i.e., cc:preconj for annotation of preconjuncts, flat:name for relations within personal names, and flat:foreign for relations within strings of foreign tokens. The eight missing universal relations in the treebank relate either to phenomena that do not occur in Slovenian (clf, compound), have not been found in the ssj200k treebank (dislocated, goeswith, reparandum) or do not enable reliable automatic identification (list, orphan, vocative). 6 Among many syntactic particularities that have also be identified in other Slavic languages (Zeman, 2015), language-specific issues requiring additional consideration in the future include the treatment of (in)direct objects (with the iobj label currently only assigned in case of two competing objects), the inventory of TAMVE particles that could have been annotated as AUX/aux (such as ne \"not\", lahko \"may\" or naj \"should\"), and the treatment of the se reflexive pronoun (currently annotated as expl in Slovenian, regardless of its specific semantic role). In total, the script for conversion of syntactic layer includes approximately 250 rules for dependency relation identification and/or head attachment, taking into account the lexical, morphological and syntactic features of individual tokens, their dependants or parents, as well as the features of tokens in the surrounding context. The conversion is performed in several iterations over tokens of a sentence, starting with the conversion of existing JOS-annotated constructions, and followed by different heuristics for annotation of previously un-annotated phenomena, including rules for root identification and punctuation attachment. In the last stage of the conversion, some mistakes and inconsistencies identified in the original ssj200k corpus are also corrected. \u017de vidimo , kajne , kako nam Kajn postaja bli\u017eji , kako nismo zaman njegovi potomci .

Conclusions This paper presented the latest Slovenian UD Treebank, obtained with automatic conversion from the ssj500k Treebank, which uses the JOS annotation scheme. This new language resource represents a valuable contribution to the Slovenian NLP landscape, where research on dependency parsing and syntactically annotated data is still scarce (Krek, 2012) . In addition to further improvements of the treebank, both in terms of size and annotation quality, priority in future work should be given to evaluation of impact of the new annotation scheme on tagging/parsing accuracy, and its potential transfer to other reference corpora for Slovenian.
