Our approach relies on a combination of probabilistic models, which w e use to model the generation of entities and their context, and kernel machines, which implement p o werful categorisers based on a similarity measure and some labelled data. This combination takes the form of the so-called Fisher kernels which implement a similarity based on an underlying probabilistic model. Such k ernels are compared with transductive inference, an alternative approach t o combining labelled and unlabelled data, again coupled with Support Vector Machines. Experiments are performed on a database of abstracts extracted from Medline. Introduction The availability of electronic databases of rapidly increasing sizes has encouraged the development o f m e t h o d s t h a t c a n t a p i n to these databases to automatically generate knowledge, for example by retrieving relevant information or extracting entities and their relationships. Machine learning seems especially relevant i n this context, because it helps performing these tasks with a minimum of user interaction. A n umber of problems like e n tity extraction or ltering can be mapped to supervised techniques like categorisation. In addition, modern supervised classi cation methods like Support Vector Machines have p r o ven to be e cient a n d versatile. They do, however, rely on the availability of labelled data, where labels indicate eg whether a document is relevant or whether a candidate expression is an interesting entity. This causes two important problems that motivate our work: 1) annotating data is often a di cult and costly task involving a lot of human work 1 , such that large collections of labelled data are di cult to obtain, and 2) interannotator agreement tends to be low i n e g g enomics collections (Krauthammer et al., 2000) , thus calling for methods that are able to deal with noise and incomplete data. On the other hand, unsupervised techniques do not require labelled data and can thus be applied regardless of the annotation problems. Unsupervised learning, however, tend to be less data-e cient than its supervised counterpart, requiring many more examples to discover signi cant features in the data, and is incapable of solving the same kinds of problems. For example, an e cient clustering technique may b e able to distribute documents in a number of well-de ned clusters. However, it will be unable to decide which clusters are relevant without a minimum of supervision. This motivates our study of techniques that rely on a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, in order to leverage the availability of large collections of unlabelled data and use a limited amount of labelled documents. The focus of this study is on a particular application to the genomics literature. In genomics, a vast amount o f k n o wledge still resides in large collections of scienti c papers such a s Medline, and several approaches have been proposed to extract, (semi-)automatically, information from such papers. These approaches range from purely statistical ones to symbolic ones relying on linguistic and knowledge processing tools (Ohta et al., 1997 Thomas et al., 2000 Proux et al., 2000, for example) . Furthermore, due to the nature of the problem at hand, meth-ods derived from machine learning are called for, (Craven and Kumlien, 1999) , whether supervised, unsupervised or relying on a combination of both. Let us insist on the fact that our work is primarily concerned with combining labelled and unlabelled data, and entity extraction is used as an application in this context. As a consequence, it is not our purpose at this point t o compare our experimental results to those obtained by speci c machine learning techniques applied to entity extraction (Cali , 1999) . Although we certainly hope that our work can be useful for entity extraction, we rather think of it as a methodological study which can hopefully be applied to di erent applications where unlabelled data may be used to improve the results of supervised learning algorithms. In addition, performing a fair comparison of our work on standard information extraction benchmarks is not straightforward: either we w ould need to obtain a large amount of unlabelled data that is comparable to the benchmark, or we w ould need to \\un-label\" a portion of the data. In both cases, comparing to existing results is di cult as the amount of information used is di erent. Classi cation for entity extraction We formulate the following (binary) classi cation problem: given an input space X, and from a dataset of N input-output pairs (x k y k ) 2 X f ; 1 +1g, w e w ant to learn a classi er h : X ! f ; 1 +1g so as to maximise the probability P (h(x) = y) o ver the xed but unknown joint input-output distribution of (x y) pairs. In this setting, binary classi cation is essentially a supervised learning problem. In order to map this to the biological entity recognition problem, we consider for each candidate term, the following binary decision problem: is the candidate a biological entity 2 (y = 1 ) o r n o t ( y = ;1). The input space is a high dimensional feature space containing lexical, morpho-syntactic and contextual features. In order to assess the validity o f c o m bining labelled and unlabelled data for the particular task of biological entity extraction, we use the following tools. First we rely on Suport Vector Machines together with transductive infer-ence (Vapnik, 1998 Joachims, 1999) , a training technique that takes both labelled and unlabelled data into account. Secondly, w e develop a Fisher kernel (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999) , which d e r i v es the similarity from an underlying (unsupervised) model of the data, used as a similarity measure (aka k ernel) within SVMs. The learning process involves the following steps: Transductive inference: learn a SVM classier h(x) using the combined (labelled and unlabelled) dataset, using traditional kernels. Fisher kernels: 1. Learn a probabilistic model of the data P (xj ) using combined unlabelled and labelled data 2. Derive the Fisher kernel K(x z) expressing the similarity i n X -space 3. Learn a SVM classi er h(x) using this Fisher kernel and inductive inference. 3 Probabilistic models for co-occurence data In (Gaussier et al., 2002) we presented a general hierarchical probabilistic model which g e neralises several established models like N a ve Bayes (Yang and Liu, 1999) , probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) or hierarchical mixtures (Toutanova et al., 2001) . In this model, data result from the observation of co-occuring objects. For example, a document collection is expressed as co-occurences between documents and words in entity extraction, co-occuring objects may be potential entities and their context, for example. For cooccuring objects i and j, the model is expressed as follows: P (i j) = X P ( ) P (ij ) X P ( j ) P (jj ) (1) where are latent classes for co-occurrences (i j) a n d are latent nodes in a hierarchy generating objects j. In the case where no hierarchy is needed (ie P ( j ) = ( = )), the model reduces to PLSA: where are now latent concepts over both i and j. P arameters of the model (class probabilities P ( ) and class-conditional P (ij ) a n d P (jj )) are learned using a deterministic annealing version of the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm (Hofmann, 1999 Gaussier et al., 2002) . Fisher kernels Probabilistic generative models like PLSA and hierarchical extensions (Gaussier et al., 2002) provide a natural way to model the generation of the data, and allow the use of well-founded statistical tools to learn and use the model. In addition, they may be used to derive a model-based measure of similarity b e t ween examples, using the so-called Fisher kernels proposed by J a a k k ola and Haussler (1999) . The idea behind this kernel is that using the structure implied by the generative model will give a more relevant similarity estimate, and allow kernel methods like the support vector machines or nearest neighbours to leverage the probabilistic model and yield improved performance (Hofmann, 2000) . The Fisher kernel is obtained using the loglikelihood of the model and the Fisher information matrix. Let us consider our collection of documents fx k g k=1:::N , and denote by `(x) = log P (xj ) the log-likelihood of the model for data x. The expression of the Fisher kernel (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999) is then: K(x 1 x 2 ) = r`(x 1 ) > I F ;1 r`(x 2 ) (3) The Fisher information matrix I F can be seen as a way t o k eep the kernel expression independent of parameterisation and is de ned as I F = E r`(x) r`(x) > , where the gradient is w.r.t. and the expectation is taken over P (xj ) . With a suitable parameterization, the information matrix I is usually approximated by the identity matrix (Hofmann, 2000) , leading to the simpler kernel expression: K(x 1 x 2 ) = r`(x 1 ) > r`(x 2 ). Depending on the model, the various loglikelihoods and their derivatives will yield different Fisher kernel expressions. For PLSA (2), the parameters are = P ( ) P (ij ) P (jj )]. From the derivatives of the likelihood `(x) = P (i j)2x log P (i j), we derive the following sim-ilarity (Hofmann, 2000) : K(x 1 x 2 ) = X P ( jd i ) P ( jd j ) P ( ) (4) + X w b P wd i b P wd j X P ( jd i w ) P ( jd j w ) P (wj ) with b P wd i , b P wd j the empirical word distributions in documents d i , d j . Transductive inference In standard, inductive SVM inference, the annotated data is used to infer a model, which i s then applied to unannotated test data. The inference consists in a trade-o between the size of the margin (linked to generalisation abilities) and the number of training errors. Transductive inference (Gammerman et al., 1998 Joachims, 1999) aims at maximising the margin between positives and negatives, while minimising not only the actual number of incorrect predictions on labelled examples, but also the expected number of incorrect predictions on the set of unannotated examples. This is done by including the unknown labels as extra variables in the original optimisation problem. In the linearly separable case, the new optimisation problem amounts now to nd a labelling of the unannotated examples and a hyperplane which separates all examples (annotated and unannotated) with maximum margin. In the non-separable case, slack v ariables are also associated to unannotated examples and the optimisation problem is now to nd a labelling and a hyperplane which optimally solves the trade-o between maximising the margin and minimising the number of misclassi ed examples (annotated and unannotated). With the introduction of unknown labels as supplementary optimisation variables, the constraints of the quadratic optimisation problem are now nonlinear, which m a k es solving more di cult. However, approximated iterative algorithms exist which can e ciently train Transductive SVMs. They are based on the principle of gradually improving the solution by switching the labels of unnannotated examples which a r e misclassi ed at the current iteration, starting from an initial labelling given by the standard (inductive) SVM. WUp Is the word capitalized? WAllUp Is the word alls capitals? WNum Does the word contain digits? Table 1 : Spelling features 6 Experiments For our experiments, we used 184 abstracts from the Medline site. In these articles, genes, proteins and RNAs were manually annotated by a biologist as part of the BioMIRE project. These articles contain 1405 occurrences of gene names, 792 of protein names and 81 of RNA names. All these entities are considered relevant biological entities. We focus here on the task of identifying names corresponding to such e n tities in running texts, without di erentiating genes from proteins or RNAs. Once candidates for biological entity names have been identi ed, this task amounts to a binary categorisation, relevant candidates corresponding to biological entity names. We divided these abstracts in a training and development set (122 abstracts), and a test set (62 abstracts). We then retained di erent portions of the training labels, to be used as labelled data, whereas the rest of the data is considered unlabelled. De nition of features First of all, the abstracts are tokenised, tagged and lemmatized. Candidates for biological entity names are then selected on the basis of the following heuristics: a token is considered a c andidate if it appears in one of the biological lexicons we have at our diposal, or if it does not belong to our general English lexicon. This simple heuristics allows us to retain 93% (1521 out of 1642) of biological names in the training set (90% in the test set), while considering only 21% of all possible candidates (5845 out of 27350 tokens). It thus provides a good pre-lter which significantly improves the performance, in terms of speed, of our system. The biological lexicons we use were provided by the BioMIRE project, and were derived from the resources available at: http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/. For each candidate, three types of features were considered. We rst retained the part-ofspeech and some spelling information (table 1 ). These features were chosen based on the inspection of gene and protein names in our lexicons. LexPROTEIN Protein lexicon LexGENE Gene lexicon LexSPECIES Biological species lexicon LEXENGLISH General English lexicon Table 2: Features provided by lexicons. The second type of features relates to the presence of the candidate in our lexical resources 3 (table 2 ). Lastly, the third type of features describes contextual information. The context we consider contains the four preceding and the four following words. However, we did not take into account the position of the words in the context, but only their presence in the right o r left context, and in addition we replaced, whenever possible, each w ord by a feature indicating (a) whether the word was part of the gene lexicon, (b) if not whether it was part of the protein lexicon, (c) if not whether it was part of the species lexicon, (d) and if not, whenever the candidate was neither a noun, an adjective nor a v erb, we replaced it by its part-of-speech. For example, the word hairless is associated with the features given in Table 3 , when encountered in the following sentence: Inhibition of the DNA-binding activity of Drosophila suppressor of hairless and of its human homolog, KBF2/RBP-J kappa, by direct protein{protein interaction with Drosophila hairless. The word hairless appears in the gene lexicon and is wrongly recognized as an adjective b y our tagger. 4 The word human, the fourth word of the right c o n text of hairless, belongs to the species lexicon, ans is thus replaced by the feature RC SPECIES. Neither Drosophila nor suppressor belong to the specialized lexicons we use, and, since they are both tagged as nouns, they are left unchanged. Prepositions and conjunctions are replaced by their part-of-speech, and pre xes LC and RC indicate whether they were found in left or right c o n text. Note that since two prepositions appear in the left context of hairless, the value of the LC PREP feature is 2. Altogether, this amounts to a total of 3690 possible features in the input space X . 3 : Features of hairless in \\...of Drosophila suppressor of hairless and of its human...\". Results In our experiments, we h a ve used the following methods: SVM trained with inductive inference, and using a linear kernel, a polynomial kernel of degree d = 2 and the so-called \\radial basis function\" kernel (Sch olkopf and Smola, 2002) . SVM trained with transductive inference, and using a linear kernel or a polynomial kernel of degree d = 2 . SVM trained with inductive inference using Fisher kernels estimated from the whole training data (without using labels), with di erent n umber of classes c in the PLSA model ( 4 ). The proportion of labelled data is indicated in the tables of results. For SVM with inductive inference, only the labelled portion is used. For transductive SVM (TSVM), the remaining, unlabelled portion is used (without the labels). For the Fisher kernels (FK), an unsupervised model is estimated on the full dataset using PLSA, and a SVM is trained with inductive inference on the labelled data only, using the Fisher kernel as similarity measure. Transductive inference Table 4 gives interesting insight i n to the effect of transductive inference. As expected, in the limit where little unannotated data is used (100% in the table), there is little to gain from using transductive inference. Accordingly, p e rformance is roughly equivalent 5 4 : F 1 scores(in %) using di erent proportions of annotated data for the following models: SVM with inductive inference (SVM) and linear (lin) kernel, second degree polynomial kernel (d=2), and RBF kernel (rbf) SVM with transductive inference (TSVM) and linear (lin) kernel or second degree polynomial (d=2) kernel. TSVM, with a slight a d v antage for RBF kernel trained with inductive inference. Interestingly, in the other limit, ie when very little annotated data is used, transductive inference does not seem to yield a marked improvement o ver inductive learning. This nding seems somehow at odds with the results reported by Joachims (1999) on a di erent task (text categorisation). We i n terpret this result as a side-e ect of the search strategy, where one tries to optimise both the size of the margin and the labelling of the unannotated examples. In practice, an exact optimisation over this labelling is impractical, and when a large amount of unlabelled data is used, there is a risk that the approximate, sub-optimal search strategy described by Joachims (1999) may fail to yield a solution that is markedly better that the result of inductive inference. For the two i n termediate situation, however, transductive inference seems to provide a sizeable performance improvement. Using only 24% of annotated data, transductive learning is able to train a linear kernel SVM that yields approximately the same performance as inductive inference on the full annotated dataset. This means that we get comparable performance using only what corresponds to about 30 abstracts, compared to the 122 of the full training set. Fisher kernels The situation is somewhat di erent for SVM trained with inductive inference, but using % annotated: 1.5% 6% 24% 100% SVM (lin) 41.22 45.34 49.67 62.97 SVM (d=2) Fisher kernels obtained from a model of the entire (non-annotated) dataset. As the use of Fisher kernels alone was unable to consistently achieve acceptable results, the similarity we used is a combination of the standard linear kernel and the Fisher kernel (a similar solution was advocate by Hofmann (2000) ). Table 5 summarises the results obtained using several types of Fisher kernels, depending on how m a n y classes were used in PLSA. FK8 (resp. FK16) indicates the model using 8 (resp. 16) classes, while combi is a combination of the Fisher kernels obtained using 4, 8, 12 and 16 classes. The e ect of Fisher kernels is not as clear-cut as that of transductive inference. For fully annotated data, we obtain results that are similar to the standard kernels, although often better than the linear kernel. Results obtained using 1.5% and 6% annotated data seem somewhat inconsistent, whith a large improvement for 1.5%, but a marked degradation for 6%, suggesting that in that case, adding labels actually hurts performance. We conjecture that this may b e an artifact of the speci c annotated set we selected. For 24% annotated data, the Fisher kernel provides results that are inbetween inductive and transductive inference using standard kernels. Discussion The results of our experiments are encouraging in that they suggest that both transductive inference and the use of Fisher kernels are potentially e ective w ay of taking unannotated data into account to improve performance. These experimental results suggest the following remark. Note that Fisher kernels can be implemented by a simple scalar product (linear kernel) between Fisher scores r`(x) (equation 3). The question arises naturally as to whether using non-linear kernels may improve results. One one hand, Fisher kernels are derived from information-geometric arguments (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999) which require that the kernel reduces to an inner-product of Fisher scores. On the other hand, polynomial and RBF kernels often display better performance than a simple dot-product. In order to test this, we h a ve performed experiments using the same features as in section 6.4, but with a second degree polynomial kernel. Overall, results are consistently worse than before, which suggest that the expression of the Fisher kernel as the inner product of Fisher scores is theoretically well-founded and empirically justi ed. Among possible future work, let us mention the following technical points: 1. Optimising the weight of the contributions of the linear kernel and Fisher kernel, eg as K(x y) = hx yi + ( 1 ; )F K (x y), 2 0 1]. 2. Understanding why the Fisher kernel alone (ie without interpolation with the linear kernel) is unable to provide a performance boost, despite attractive theoretical properties. In addition, the performance improvement obtained by both transductive inference and Fisher kernels suggest to use both in cunjunction. To our knowledge, the question of whether this would allow to \\bootstrap\" the unlabelled data by using them twice (once for estimating the kernel, once in transductive learning) is still an open research question. Finally, regarding the application that we have targeted, namely entity recognition, the use of additional unlabelled data may help us to overcome the current performance limit on our database. None of the additional experiments conducted internally using probabilisitc models and symbolic, rule-based methods have been able to yield F 1 scores higher than 63-64% on the same data. In order to improve on this, we h a ve collected several hundred additional abstracts by querying the MedLine database. After pre-processing, this yields more than a hundred thousand (unlabelled) candidates that we m a y use with transductive inference and/or Fisher kernels. Conclusion In this paper, we presented a comparison between two state-of-the-art methods to combine labelled and unlabelled data: Fisher kernels and transductive inference. Our experimental results suggest that both method are able to yield a sizeable improvement in performance. For example transductive learning yields performance similar to inductive learning with only about a quarter of the data. These results are very encouraging for tasks where annotation is costly while unannotated data is easy to obtain, like our task of biological entity recognition. In addition, it provides a way to bene t from the availability of large electronic databases in order to automatically extract knowledge. 9 Acknowledgement We thank Anne Schiller, Agnes Sandor and Violaine Pillet for help with the data and related experimental results.
