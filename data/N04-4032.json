This work investigates the effects of automatically detecting these phenomena on a probabilistic parser's performance. We demonstrate that a state-of-the-art segmenter, relative to a pause-based segmenter, gives more than 45% of the possible error reduction in parser performance, and that presentation of interruption points to the parser improves performance over using sentence boundaries alone. Introduction Parsing speech can be useful for a number of tasks, including information extraction and question answering from audio transcripts. However, parsing conversational speech presents a different set of challenges than parsing text: sentence boundaries are not well-defined, punctuation is absent, and disfluencies (edits and restarts) impact the structure of language. Several efforts have looked at detecting sentence boundaries in speech, e.g. (Kim and Woodland, 2001; Huang and Zweig, 2002) . Metadata extraction efforts, like (Liu et al., 2003) , extend this task to include identifying self-interruption points (IPs) that indicate a disfluency or restart. This paper explores the usefulness of identifying boundaries of sentence-like units (referred to as SUs) and IPs in parsing conversational speech. Early work in parsing conversational speech was rulebased and limited in domain (Mayfield et al., 1995) . Results from another rule-based system (Core and Schubert, 1999) suggests that standard parsers can be used to identify speech repairs in conversational speech. Work in statistically parsing conversational speech (Charniak and Johnson, 2001) has examined the performance of a parser that removes edit regions in an earlier step. In contrast, we train a parser on the complete (human-specified) segmentation, with edit-regions included. We choose to work with all of the words within edit regions anticipating that making the parallel syntactic structures of the edit region available to the parser can improve its performance in identifying that structure. Our work makes use of the Structured Language Model (SLM) as a parser and an existing SU-IP detection algorithm, described next. Background Structured Language Model The SLM assigns a probability \u00a2 \u00a4\u00a3 \u00a6\u00a5 \u00a8 \u00a7 \u00a9 to every sentence \u00a5 and its every possible binary parse \u00a9 . The terminals of \u00a9 are the words of \u00a5 with POS tags, and the nodes of \u00a9 are annotated with phrase headwords and non-terminal labels. Let \u00a5 be a sentence of length words with added sentence boundary markers <s> and \"! $# \u00a8 </s>. Let \u00a5 &% ' ( ) 10 20 20 % be the word 3 -prefix of the sentence -the words from the beginning of the sentence up to the current position 3 and \u00a5 % \u00a9 % the word-parse 3 -prefix. Figure 1 shows a word-parse 3 -prefix; h_0 .. h_{-m} are the exposed heads, each head being a pair (headword, non-terminal label), or (word, POS tag) in the case of a root-only tree. The exposed heads at a given position 3 in the input sentence are a function of the word-parse 3 -prefix. The joint probability \u00a2 \u00a4\u00a3 \u00a6\u00a5 4 \u00a7 5\u00a9 of a word sequence \u00a5 and a complete parse \u00a9 can be broken into: 6 87 @9 BA C ED GF H PI RQ TS U V S XW 6 87 `Y U ba 9 U dc S C U ec S D gf 6 87 ih U pa 9 U dc S C U ec S A Y U D gf H &q U r sV S 6 87 ut U r a 9 U ec S C U ec S A Y U A h U A t U S Xv uv uv t U r Gc S D @w (1) where: x \u00a5 % Ry # \u00a9 % Ry # is the word-parse \u00a3 3 ' -prefix x % is the word predicted by the WORD-PREDICTOR x ) % is the tag assigned to % by the TAGGER x % The SLM is based on three probabilities, each estimated using deleted interpolation and parameterized (approximated) as follows: 6 87 `Y U a 9 U dc S C U dc S D 6 7 `Y U a \u00a1 \u00a3\u00a2 A \u00a1 pc S D gA (2) 6 87 ih U a Y U A 9 U dc S C U dc S D 6 7 ih U a Y U A \u00a1 \u00a3\u00a2 A \u00a1 pc S D A (3) 6 87 ut U r a 9 U C U D 6 7 ut U r a \u00a1 \u00a3\u00a2 A \u00a1 pc S D v (4) Since the number of parses for a given word prefix \u00a5 % grows exponentially with 3 , \u00a4 \u00a6\u00a5 \u00a9 % \u00a8 \u00a7 \u00a4 \u00a9 \u00a3 % , the state space of our model is huge even for relatively short sentences, so the search strategy uses pruning. Each model component is initialized from a set of parsed sentences after undergoing headword percolation and binarization. The position of the headword within a constituent is specified using a rule-based approach. Assuming the index of the headword on the right-hand side of the rule is 3 , we binarize the constituent by following one of the two binarization schemes in Figure 4 . Intermediate nodes created receive the label 1 . The choice between the two schemes is made according to the identity of the label on the left-hand-side of a rewrite rule. An N-best EM variant is employed to jointly reestimate the model parameters so that perplexity on training data is decreased, i.e. increasing likelihood. Experimentally, the reduction in perplexity carries over to the test set. 1 Any resemblance to X-bar theory is purely coincidental.

SU and IP Detection The system used here for SU and IP detection is (Kim et al., 2004) , modulo differences in training data. It combines decision tree models of prosody with a hidden event language model in a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework for detecting events at each word boundary, similar to (Liu et al., 2003) . Differences include the use of lexical pattern matching features (sequential matching words or POS tags) as well as prosody cues in the decision tree, and having a joint representation of SU and IP boundary events rather than separate detectors. On the DARPA RT-03F metadata test set (NIST, 2003) , the model has 35.0% slot error rate (SER) for SUs (75.7% recall, 87.7% precision), and 68.8% SER for edit IPs (41.8% recall, 79.8% precision) on reference transcripts, using the rt eval scoring tool. 2 While these error rates are relatively high, it is a difficult task and the SU performance is at the state of the art. Since early work on \"sentence\" segmentation simply looked at pause duration, we designed a decision tree classifier to predict SU events based only on the pause duration after a word boundary. This model served as a baseline condition, referred to here as the \"na\u00efve\" predictor since it makes no use of other prosodic or lexical cues that are important for preventing IPs or hesitations from triggering false SU detection. The na\u00efve predictor has SU SER of 68.8%, roughly twice that of the HMM, with a large loss in recall (43.2% recall, 79.0% precision). Corpus The data used in this work is the treebank (TB3) portion of the Switchboard corpus of conversational telephone speech, which includes sentence boundaries as well as the reparandum and interruption point of disfluencies. The data consists of 816 hand-transcribed conversation sides (566K words), of which we reserve 128 conversation sides (61K words) for evaluation testing according to the 1993 NIST evaluation choices. We use a subset of Switchboard data -hand-annotated for SUs and IPs -for training the SU/IP boundary event detector, and for providing the oracle versions of these events as a control in our experiments. The annotation conventions for this data, referred to as V5 (Strassel, 2003) , are slightly different from that used in the TB3 an-notations in a few important ways. Notably for this work, V5 annotates IPs for both conversational fillers (such as filled pauses and discourse markers) and self-edit disfluencies, while TB3 represents only edit-related IPs. This difference is addressed by explicitly distinguishing between these types in the IP detection model. In addition, the V5 conventions define an SU as including only one independent main clause, so the size of the \"segments\" available for parsing is sometimes smaller than in TB3. Further, the SU boundaries were determined by annotators who actually listened to the speech signal, vs. annotated from text alone as for TB3. One consequence of the differences is a small amount of additional error due to train/test mismatch. More importantly, the \"ground truth\" for the syntactic structure must be mapped to the SU segmentation, both for training and test. In many cases, the original syntactic constituents span multiple SUs, but we follow a simple rule in generating this new SU-based truth: only those constituents contained entirely within an SU would be retained. In practice, this means eliminating a few high-level constituents. The effect is usually to change the interpretation of some sentence-level conjunctions to be discourse markers, rather than conjoining two main clauses. This change is arguably an improvement, since the SU annotation relies on a human annotation that takes into consideration acoustic information (not only the words). Experiments In all experiments, the SLM parser was trained on the baseline truth Switchboard corpus described above, with hand-annotated SUs and optionally IPs. For testing, the system was presented with conversation sides segmented according to the various SU-predictions, and evaluated on its performance in predicting the true syntactic structure. Experimental Variables We seek to explore how much impact current metadata detection algorithms have over the na\u00efve pause-based segmentation. To this end, we test along two experimental dimensions: SU segmentation and IP detection. Some type of segmentation is critical to most parsers. In the SU dimension, we tested three conditions. Across these conditions, the parser training was held constant, but the test segmentation varied across three cases: (i) oracle, hand-labeled SU segmentation; (ii) automatic, SU segmentation from the automatic detection system using both prosody and lexical cues (Kim et al., 2004) ; and (iii) na\u00efve, SU segmentation from a decision tree predictor using only pause duration cues. The SUs are included as words, similar to sentence boundaries in prior SLM work. By varying the SU segmentation of the test data for our system, we gain insight into how the performance of SU detection changes the overall accuracy of the parser. We expect interruption points to be useful to parsing, since edit points often indicate a restart point, and the preceding syntactic phrase should attach to the tree differently. In the IP dimension, we examined two conditions (present and absent). For each condition, we retrained the parser including hand-labeled IPs, since the vocabulary of available \"words\" is different when the IP is included as an input token. The two IP conditions are: (a) No IP, training the parser on syntax that did not include IPs as words, and testing on segmented input that also did not include IP tokens; and (b) IP, training and testing on input that includes IPs as words. The incorporation of IPs as words may not be ideal, since it reduces the number of true words available to an N-gram model at a given point, but it has the advantages of simplicity and consistency with SU treatment. Because the na\u00efve system does not predict IPs, we only have experiments for 5 of the 6 possible combinations. Evaluation We evaluated parser performance by using bracket precision and recall scores, as well as bracket-crossing, using the parseval metric (Sekine and Collins, 1997; Black et al., 1991) . This bracket-counting metric for parsers, requires that the input words (and, by implication, sentences) be held constant across test conditions. Since our experiments deliberately vary the segmentation, we needed to evaluate each conversation side as a single \"sentence\" in order to obtain meaningful results across different segmentations. We construct this top-level sentence by attaching the parser's proposed constituents for each SU to a new top-level constituent (labeled TIPTOP). Thus, we can compare two different segmentations of the same data, because it ensures that the segmentations will agree at least at the beginning and end of the conversation. Segmentation errors will of course cause some mismatches, but that possibility is what we are investigating. For evaluation, we ignore the TIPTOP bracket (which always contains the entire conversation side), so this technique does not interfere with accurate bracket counting, but allows segmentation errors to be evaluated at the level of bracket-counting. The SLM parser uses binary trees, but the syntactic structures we are given as truth often branch in N-ary ways, where \u00a1 . The parse trees used for training the SLM use bar-level nodes to transform N-ary trees into binary ones; the reverse mapping of SLM-produced binary trees back to N-ary trees is done by simply removing the bar-level constituents. Finally, to compare the IP-present conditions with the non-IP conditions, we ignore IP tokens when counting brackets. Results Table 1 shows the parser performance: average bracketcrossing (lower is better), precision and recall (higher is We find that the HMM-based SU detection system achieves a 7% improvement in precision and recall over the na\u00efve pause-based system, and an 18% reduction in average bracket crossing. Further, the use of IPs as input tokens improves parser performance, especially when the segmentation is imperfect. While segmentation has an impact on parsing, it is not the limiting factor: the best possible bracketing respecting the automatic segmentation has a 96.50% recall and 99.35% precision. Adding punctuation to the oracle case (Oracle+P) improves performance, as seen more clearly with the Fmeasure because of changes in the precision-recall balance. The F-measures goes from 72.6 for oracle/no-IP to 74.3 for oracle+P/no-IP to 74.7 for oracle+P/IP. The fact that punctuation is useful on top of the oracle segmentation suggests that a richer representation of structural metadata would be beneficial. The reasons why IPs do not have much of an impact in the oracle case are not clear -it could be a modeling issue or it could be simply that the IPs add robustness to the automatic segmentation. Discussion In comparison to the na\u00efve pause-based SU detector, using an SU detector based on prosody and lexical cues gives us more than 45% of the possible gain to the best possible (oracle) case, despite a relatively high SU error rate. We hypothesize that low SU and IP recall in the na\u00efve segmenter created a much larger parse search space, leading to more opportunities for errors. The improvement is promising, and suggests that research to improve metadata extraction can have a direct impact on the performance of other natural language applications that deal with conversational speech. The use of SUs and IPs as input words may result in a loss of information, reducing the \"true\" word history available to the parser component models. Further research using the structured language model could incorporate these metadata directly into the model, allowing it to take advantage of higher-level metadata without reducing the effective number of words available to the model. In addition, just as the SLM is useful for both parsing and language modeling, it could be used to predict metadata for its own sake or to improve word recognition, with or without the word-based representation.
