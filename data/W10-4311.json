    "article": "This study investigates the use of Same -a relation that connects the parts of a discontinuous discourse segment -in the Discourse Graphbank (Wolf et al., 2004) . Our analysis reveals systematic deviations from the definition of the Same relation and a substantial number of confusions between Same and Elaboration relations. We discuss some methodological and theoretical implications of these findings. Introduction Coherence relations and their composition (usually assumed to be strictly hierarchical, i.e., treelike) form the core of most corpus-linguistic and computational work on discourse structure (see Taboada & Mann 2006 for an overview). The assumption that discourse structure can be modeled as a tree has recently come under attack e.g. in Wolf & Gibson (2003 , 2006; henceforth WG) . Based on the Discourse Graphbank (Wolf et al 2004; henceforth DG) , a manually annotated corpus of 135 newspaper and newswire texts, WG claim that less constrained graph structures are needed that allow for crossed dependencies (i.e. structures in which discourse units ABCD (not necessarily adjacent) have relations AC and BD) and multiple-parent structures (where a unit enters more than one coherence relation and is thus dominated by more than one node). 1  Among the 11 types of relations distinguished in DG, the Elaboration relation, where two asymmetrically related discourse units are \"centered around a common event of entity\" (Wolf   1 The validity of this claim is contested in Egg & Redeker (2010) . et al 2003: 12) , stands out by its heavy involvement in these violations of tree structure constraints. Elaboration relations are involved in 50.52% of all crossed dependency structures and in 45.83% of multiple-parent structures. These high percentages are in part due to the high overall frequency of Elaboration relations (37.97% of all relations), but clearly exceed that base rate. Elsewhere, Elaboration relations, esp. those where the elaborandum is an entity and not a whole proposition, have been criticized as belonging more to referential coherence than to relational coherence (Knott el at 2001) . In this study, we show that WG's (somewhat idiosyncratic) definition of the Elaboration relation seems to lead to confusion with the 'pseudo-relation' Same. The 'pseudo-relation' Same-Unit was introduced by Marcu (Carlson & Marcu 2001) to deal with discontinuous discourse units in the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson, Marcu & Okurowski 2002) . Same-Unit (re)connects the parts of a discourse unit that is disrupted by embedded material. In the tree representation, the intervening material is attached to one of the constituent units of the Same-Unit relation (Carlson & Marcu 2001:23-26) . In DG, this relation is called Same and accounts for 17.21% of all relations; only Elaboration and Similarity are more frequent. 2 As DG allows multiple attachments, Same should be expected to be regularly associated with multiple-parent structures, and it is: the percentage of Same relations is higher in multiple-parent structures than overall, and the reduction of multiple-parent structures when Same relations are removed from the DG is second only to Elaboration (Wolf & Gibson 2003:280-282) . Our explorations of Same relations in DG revealed a substantial number of cases that do not seem to fit WG's definition of this relation, most notably confusions with Elaboration relations and a surprising number of cases where there is no intervening segment to be bridged by the Same relation. In this paper, we will present these findings and discuss some consequences for discourse segmentation and the annotation of coherence relations. Same relations in DG The DG coding manual (Wolf et al 2003:15) stipulates as the only condition for a Same relation that a discourse segment must have \"intervening material\". The example in the manual tacitly fits the much more restrictive definition given in (Wolf & Gibson 2003:255) and in (Wolf & Gibson 2006:28) : \"A same relation holds if a subject NP is separated from its predicate by an intervening discourse segment\". Among the 534 Same relations in DG, 3 we have identified 128 cases (23.98%) where this definition does not seem to apply. Sixty-four of these cases also do not satisfy the broader definition in the coding manual (see 2.3). Same or Elaboration? In 35 cases, the Same relation is applied to constructions that are elsewhere labeled Elaborations. Consider the parallel examples (1) and ( 2 In other examples, a general difference between these Same and Elaboration examples lies in the attachment of the intervening segment: in the Same cases, the intervening segment might be attached to the preceding discourse segment, and in the Elaboration cases to the following segment. The confusion between the symmetric Same relation (both segments have in principle equal status) and the asymmetric Elaboration relation (combining an elaborandum with a less central elaborating segment) might have been caused by WG's definition, which stipulates that the segments be \"centered around a common event or entity\" (Wolf et al 2003: 12) and thus does not reflect the asymmetry of the Elaboration relation. Violations of definitional constraints There are other cases, besides those discussed in 2.1, where the formal requirement of the restrictive definition is not met. In 20 cases, the Same relations joins coordinated or disjoint NP's as in example (3): Presumably the annotators were using the less restrictive definition in the coding manual. This explanation cannot account for the last category of problematic cases we now turn to. Spurious Same relations We found 64 cases in DG where Same is assigned to two adjacent discourse segments, thus violating the essential criterion of \"intervening material\". Such 'spurious' Same relations occur with various constructions including the following: \u2022 Temporal \"as\"-clauses (9) [31] it came [32] as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections. (Text 123, wsj_0655) The 64 spurious Same relations are concentrated in only 20 of the 135 texts. Fifty-one of those cases occur in ten texts that were also used in the RST Discourse Treebank. This gives us the interesting opportunity to compare the DG and RST Treebank analyses for these 51 cases. As Table 1 It is instructive to look at the subtype of Elaboration assigned to these cases, which most commonly is the relation Elaboration-objectattribute-e. It applies to clausal modifiers, usually postmodifiers of a noun phrase, that express an intrinsic quality of an object. Carlson & Marcu (2001:55) The constructions with spurious Same relations in DG thus often involve restrictive modification, implying a very close tie between the segments involved, possibly prompting the annotators to as it were undo the segmentation. \u2022 Complement clauses Segmentation rules Any annotation of discourse relations requires rules for segmenting the text into elementary discourse units. DG follows Carlson & Marcu (2003) in assuming clauses, modifiers and attributions as discourse segments (DSs), but adds some \"refinements\" (Wolf et al., 2003:8) that may be responsible for some of the problematic cases discussed in section 2. 4 In particular, two of the additional stipulations refer to \"elaborations\": (Wolf et al., 2003:8) \"Time-, space-, personal-or detailelaborations are treated as DSs\" (Wolf et al., 2003:9) . This might simply be an unfortunate equivocation, but still is likely to confuse annotators by confounding the segmentation and relation annotation tasks. Conclusions Our analysis of the Same relation in DG has shown systematic deviations from the definition of this (pseudo-)relation and a substantial number of confusions between Same and Elaboration, both in cases where Same cannot apply, as there is no intervening segment, and in cases where both might apply, but parsimony would demand to treat parallel cases equally. Some of the problematic cases may have been caused by the use of relational terminology (\"elaboration\") in two of the segmentation rules. The problems are not just methodological, though, but may raise questions about the conceptual status of Elaboration relations. The confusion of a bone fide coherence relation with a purely technical construction that serves to recombine the parts of an interrupted segment must be worrisome. More specifically, the comparison with the annotation in the RST Discourse Treebank reveals that many of the 'spurious' Same relations in DG are analyzed as Elaboration-object-attribute-e relations in the RST Treebank. This is exactly the subcategory of Elaboration relations that most clearly operate on the level of entities instead of propositions, and thus arguably might not be proper discourse relations (Knott et al. 2001) . This holds a fortiori as Carlson & Marcu's (2001) definition of the Elaboration-object-attribute-e relation requires a restrictive modifier construction. The increasing availability of corpora annotated for discourse structure will facilitate the further investigation of these questions.
