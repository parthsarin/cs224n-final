We show some of these contextual features can be very discriminant and combining them with MWEspecific features results in a relatively accurate extraction. We define context as a sequential structure and not a bag of words, consequently, it becomes much more informative about MWEs. Introduction Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are an important research topic in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Efficient and effective extraction and interpretation of MWEs is crucial in most NLP tasks. They exist in many types of text and cause major problems in all kinds of natural language processing applications (Sag et al., 2002) . However, identifying and lexicalizing these important but hard to identify structures need to be improved in most major computational lexicons (Calzolari et al., 2002) . Jackendoff (1997) estimates that the number of MWEs is equal to the number of single words in a speaker's lexicon, while Sag et al. (2002) believe that the number is even greater than this. Moreover, as a language evolves, the number of MWEs consistently increases. MWEs are a powerful way of extending languages' lexicons. Their role in language evolution is so important that according to Baldwin and Kim (2010) , \"It is highly doubtful that any language would evolve without MWEs of some description\". The efficient identification and extraction of MWEs can positively influence many other NLP tasks, e.g., part of speech tagging, parsing, syntactic disambiguation, semantic tagging, machine translation, and natural language generation. MWEs also have important applications outside NLP. For instance in document indexing, information retrieval (Acosta et al., 2011) , and cross lingual information retrieval (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996) . In this paper we present a method of extracting MWEs which is relatively different from most of the state of the art approaches. We characterize MWEs based on the statistical properties of the immediate context they occur in. For each possible MWE candidate we define a set of contextual features (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, etc.). The contextual feature vector is then enriched with a few MWE-specific features such as the frequency of its components, type frequency of the candidate MWE, and the association between these two (which is learned by a supervised model). Subsequently the MWEhood of the extracted candidates is predicted based on this feature representation, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The system reaches a relatively high accuracy of predicting MWEs on unseen data. Previous Work Attempts to extract MWEs are of different types. The most common techniques are primarily focused on collocations. Some of these techniques are rule-based and symbolic e.g., (Seretan, 2011; Goldman et al., 2001; Nerima et al., 2003; Baldwin, 2005; Piao et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Jacquemin et al., 1997) . Some rely on lexicons (Michiels and Dufour, 1998; Li et al., 2003) and (Pearce, 2001) that uses WordNet to evaluate the candidate MWE based on anti-collocations. Other approaches are hybrid in the sense that they benefit from both statistical and linguistic information. For instance (Seretan and Wehrli, 2006; Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002; Piao and McEnery, 2001; Dias, 2003) . There are also fully statistical approaches. For instance (Pecina, 2010; Evert, 2005; Lapata and Lascarides, 2003; Smadja et al., 1996) , or the early work Xtract (Smadja, 1993) . Other approaches consider all types of MWEs (Zhang et al., 2006) . Some of these approaches build upon generic properties of MWEs, for instance semantic non-compositionality (Van de Cruys and Moir\u00f3n, 2007) . A different approach is presented in (Widdows and Dorow, 2005) . The authors present a graphbased model to capture and assess fixed expressions in form of Noun and/or Noun. There are also bilingual models which are mostly based on the assumption that a translation of the MWE in a source language exists in a target language. For instance (de Medeiros Caseli et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2009), and (Moir\u00f3n and Tiedemann, 2006) which measures MWEs candidates' idiomaticity based on translational entropy. Another example is (Duan et al., 2009) which is a hybrid model that aims at extracting bilingual (English-Chinese) MWEs . It combines Multiple Sequence Alignment Model with some filtering based on hard rules to obtain an improved extraction. A more generic model is presented in (Ramisch, 2012) where the author develops a flexible platform that can accept different types of criteria (from statistical to deep linguistic) in order to extract and filter MWEs. However, in this work, as the author claims, the quality of the extracted MWEs is highly dependent on the level of deep linguistic analysis, and thereby, the role of statistical criterion is less significant. Motivation We propose an original method to extract multiword expressions based on statistical contextual features, e.g., a set of immediate prefixes, suffixes, circumfixes, infixes to circumfixes, etc., (see Sec. 2). These features are used to form a feature representation, which together with a set of annotations train a supervised model in order to predict and extract MWEs from a large corpus. We observed some discriminant behavior in contextual features (such as prefixes, suffixes, circumfixes, etc.) of a set of manually selected MWEs. A supervised model is then applied to learn MWEhood based on these features. In general, modeling lexical and syntactic (and not semantic) characteristics of continuous MWEs is the focus of this paper. In order for the MWE de-composability condition to hold, we consider bigrams and above (up to size 4). Idiomaticity at some level is a necessary prerequisite of MWEs. Hereby, we consider idiomaticity at lexical, syntactic and statistical levels, and leave the semantic idiomaticity to the future work. Relatively similar models have been previously applied to problems similar to MWEs, for instance named entity recognition (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007; Ratinov and Roth, 2009) . The focus on contextual features allows some degree of generalization, i.e., we can apply this model to a family of languages. 1 However, this work focuses only on English MWEs. Proposed System We prepared a corpus that comprises 100K Wikipedia documents for each of the mentioned languages. 1 After cleaning and segmenting the corpus, we extracted all possible n-grams (up to size 7) and their token and type frequencies. Then two basic statistical filters were applied in order to systematically decrease the size of our immense n-gram set: (i) Frequency filter, where we filter an n-gram if its frequency is less than the ratio between tokens and types, where for a given size of n-grams, the total number of n-grams and the number of distinct n-grams of that size, are considered tokens and types, respectively. (ii) Redundancy filter where we consider an n-gram to be redundant if it is subsumed by any other n -gram, where n > n. This gives us a pruned set of ngrams which we refer to as the statistically significant set. For the set of significant n-grams a set of statistical features are extracted which will be described shortly. Fig. 1 illustrates the workflow of the system.  While studying the English corpus and different MWEs therein, it was observed that often, MWEs (as well as some other types of syntactic units) are followed, preceded or surrounded by a limited number of high frequency significant n-gram types. Moreover, our manual evaluation and constituency tests reveal that generally when a frequent significant prefix co-occurs with a frequent significant suffix, they form a circumfix whose significant infixes are (i) many, (ii) can mostly be considered syntactic unit, specifically when it comes to bi/trigrams. The immediate proximity of these particular context features to MWEs keeps emerging while evaluating similar circumfixes. We believe it suggests the presence of a discriminant attribute that we model with features 5-8 (see Table 3 ) and learn using a supervised model. Nevertheless, the fact that MWEs share these features with other types of syntactic units encourages introducing more MWE-specific features (namely, MWE's frequency, the frequency of its components, and their associations), then enforcing the learning model to recognize a MWE based on the combination of these two types of features. Note that the association between the type frequency of a MWE, and the frequency of its components is implicitly learned by the supervised model throughout the learning phase. A candidate MWE can be represented as: y = (x 1 , ..., x m , x m+1 , ..., x n ) \u2208 N 0 (1) Where x 1 , ..., x m are contextual, and x m+1 , ..., x n are specific features (m = 8, and n = 11). These features are described in Table 3 . contextual features x 1 # set of all possible prefixes of y x 2 # set of distinct prefixes of y x 3 # set of all possible suffixes of y x 4 # set of distinct suffixes of y x 5 # set of all possible circumfixes of y x 6 # set of distinct circumfixes of y (C) x 7 # set of all possible infixes to members of C x 8 # set of distinct infixes to members of C specific features x 9 the size of y x 10 number of occurrences of y in the corpus x 11 list of frequencies of the components of y Table 3 : Description of the extracted features A prefix of y is the longest n-gram immediately before y, if any or the boundary marker #, otherwise. A suffix of y is the longest n-gram immediately after y, if any or the boundary marker #, otherwise. A circumfix (c i \u2208 C) of y is the pair (p, s) where p and s are respectively the prefix and the suffix of a given occurrence of y. An Infix of c i is an n-gram that occurs between p and s. Components to generate candidate MWEs, filter them and extract their relevant features were very memory and CPU intensive. To address the performance issues we implemented parallel programs and ran them on a high performance cluster. Experimental Results A set of \u2248 10K negative and positive English MWE examples were annotated. This set does not particularly belong in any specific genre, as the examples were chosen randomly from across a general-purpose corpus. This set comprises an equal number of positive and negative annotations. Part of it was annotated manually at UNDL foundation, 2 and part of it was acquired from the manually examined MWE lexicon presented in (Nerima et al., 2003) . The set of positive and negative annotated n-grams is detailed in Table 4 . The bias toward bigrams is due to the fact that the majority of manually verified MWEs that could be obtained are bigrams. This set was divided into 1/3 test and 2/3 training data, which were selected randomly but were evenly distributed with respect to positive and negative examples. The test set remains completely unseen to the model during the learning phase. We then train a linear SVM: h(y) = w y + b (2) Where h(y) is a discriminant hyperplane, w is the weight vector, and y is a set of MWE examples, where each example is defined as: y j = x 1 , ..., x 11 .  The significance of x 9 is due to the fact that in the training set majority of MWEs are bigrams. Therefore, by the SVM, being a bigram is considered as a substantial feature of MWEs. Nevertheless since the number of negative and positive examples which are bigrams are approximately the same, the bias toward x 9 in discriminating MWEs from non-MWE balances out. However its association with other features which is implicitly learned still has an impact on discriminating these two classes. x 7 and x 8 are the next two important features, as we expected. These two are the features whose magnitude suggests the presence or lack of contexts such as (the..of ). Conclusions and Future Work We presented a method to extract MWEs based on the immediate context they occur in, using a supervised model. Several contextual features were extracted from a large corpus. The size of the corpus had a profound effect on the effectiveness of these features. The presented MWE extraction model reaches a relatively high accuracy on an unseen test set. In future work, the efficiency of this approach on languages other than English will be studied. Furthermore, other features -specifically deep linguistic ones e.g., degree of constituency as described in (Ponvert et al., 2011) or POS tags, will be added to the feature representation of MWE candidates. Finally context-based probabilistic scores which are linguistically motivated can be investigated and compared with the supervised model. Another interesting work would be to introduce kernels so that we can go from statistics of contextual features to training the supervised model directly on the textual context. \u22121 1 \u22121 1 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 1 \u22121 1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 1 1 1 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 \u22121 1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 1 1 \u22121 1 1 1 1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 1",
