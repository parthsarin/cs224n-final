To cope with this problem, we introduce a hybrid method of integrating corpus-based approach with knowledge-based techniques, using a wide-variety of information that comes from annotated corpora and a machinereadable dictionary. When the occurrence frequency on the corpora is low, we use preference rules to determine PP attachment based on clues from conceptual information. An experiment has proven that our hybrid method is both effective and applicable in practice. Introduction The resolution of prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity is a difficult problem in NLP. There have been many proposals to attack this problem. Traditional proposMs are mainly based on knowledge-based techniques which heavily depend on empirical knowledge encoded in handcrafted rules and domain knowledge in knowledge base: they are therefore not scalable. Recent work has turned to corpus-based or statistical approaches (e.g. Hindle and Rooth 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Reynar and Roukos 1994 , Brill and Resnik 1994 , Collins and Brooks 1995) . Unlike traditional proposals, corpus-based approaches need not to prepare a large amount of handcrafted rules, they have therefore the merit of being scalable or easy to transfer to new domains. However, corpusbased approaches shffer fi'om the notorious sparsedata problem: estimations based on low occurrenee frequencies are very unreliable and often result in bad performances in disambiguation. To cope with this problem, Brill and Resnik (1994) use word classes from Word-Net noun hierarchy to (:luster words into semantic classes. Collins and Brooks (1995) on the other hand use morphological analysis t)oth on test and tr~fining data. Unfortunately, all these smoothing methods are not efficient enough to make a significant improvement on perforlnancc. Instead of using pure statistical approaches stated above, wc propose a hybrid approach to attack PP attachment problem. We employ corpusbased likelihood analysis to choose most-likely attachment. Where the occurrence frequency is too low to make a reliable choice, wc turn to use conceptual infornlation froln a machine-readable dictionary to to make decision on PP attachments. We use this disambiguation method to buihl a disambiguation module in PFTE system, l In what follows we first outline the idea of using hybrid information to sui)ply preferences for resolving ambiguous PP attachment. We then describe how this information is used in disambiguating PP attachment. We put the hybrid approach in an disambiguation algorithm. Finally, we show an experiment and its result. Using Multiple Information in Disambiguation Like other work, we use fonr head words to make decision on PP attachment: the main verb v, the head noun (nl) ahead of the preposition (p), and the head noun (n2) of the object of the preposition. In the later discussion, the four head words are referred to as a quadrul)le (v nl p n2). Analyzing the strategies human beings employ in PP attachment disambiguation, we f(mnd that a wide-variety of information supplies important clues for disambiguation. It includes presuppositions, syntactic and lexical cues, collocations, syntactic and semantic restrictions, features of head words, conceptual relationships, and world knowledge. We use clues that are general and reliable 1PFTE stands for Parser for Free Text of English. PFTE system is a versatile parsing system in development which (:overs a wide range of phenomena in lexical, syntactic, semantic dimensions. It is designed as a linguistic tool for at)plications in text understanding, database generation fi'om text and computer-based language learning. so that they make the computation efficient and extensible. The information or clues we use are the following: 1. Syntactic or lexical cues. If nl is same as n2, for exalnple, often nlTPP is a fixed t)hr;~se su(:h as .step by step. 2. Co-oee'wr'rences. The (;o-o(:(:llrrences of triples and pairs in (v nl p n2) colne frmn annotated eorl)ora (Se(:tion 4). 3. Syntactic and semantic features. Features of v or nl n2 sometimes in(licate the \"corre(:t\" attachment. For examt)le,if v is a movement, p is to and n2 is a t)lace or direction, the PP teuds to be attached to the verb. Conceptual relationships 1)etween v and n2, or between nl and n2. These relationships, which reflect the role-expections of the pre-1)osition, sut)l)ly important chics for disambiguation. For example, in the sentence Peter broke the window by a ,stone, we are sure that the PP by a stone is att~u'hed to broke/v by knowing that stone~n2 is an instrument for broke/v. V~fe use co-occurrence informatioi~ in corl)ust)ased (lis;mfl)iguation and other information in rule-b,~sed disambiguation. Later, we will discuss how to ac(tuire above information and use it in disambiguation. 3 Estimation based on Corpora In this section, we consider two kinds of PP attachment in our corlms-t)ased al)l)roaeh , nalnely, attachment to verb phrase (VP atta('lmmnt) and to nmm i)hrase (NP attachment). Here, we use two ammtated corpora: EDR English Corpus 2 and Susanne Corpus a to SUpl)ly training data. Both of theln (-(retain tagged syntactic structure for each sentence in thein. That is, each PP in the corl)ora has 1)een attached to an unique l)hrase. RA (v,nl,p,n2) , a score fi'om 0 to 1, ix defined as a value of counts of VP attachments divided by the total of occurrences of (v,nl,1),n2) in the training data. 4 RA(v,nl,p,n2) = f (,,vl,,,,,I,v,,ce) wl,,,,,1,v,,,u ) (1) f(v,nl ,p,n2) ,~ f ( vPlv ,,~ L ,p,u2) -/(,,vl ..... I,v,-2)+y(, In (1), the symbol f denotes frequency of a parti('ular tuple in the training data. For exami)le, 2FDR English Corpus, conq)iled by Japan Ehx'tronic Dictionary Research Institute, Ltd, eontalllS 160,000 sentences with annotated nmrphologie, syntactic m,d semantic information. aSusaxme Corpus,cOral)ileal ])y Oeoffre.y Saml~so:n , is an amtotated corpus coml)risiltg about 130,000 words of written American English text. 'lWe assulue that only two kinds of PP atta(:hmerits: VP or NP attachment in the training data. f(vl) I share,apartment,with,friend) is the numl)er -of~.imes the quadruple (share, apartlnent, with, friend) is seelt with a VP attachment. Thus, we could choose a attaefiment actor(ling to RA score= if RA>0.5 choose VP attachment, otherwise choose NP attachment. Most of quadruples in test data are not in the training data, however. We thus turn to collect triples of (vd),nl),(nl,p,n2),(v,nl,l)) and 1)airs of (v,t)),(nl,p),(l),n2) like Collins and Brooks (1995) did, and coinpute RA score by ( 2 ) and (3). RA(v,nl,p,n2) = f(vVl,,p,n2)+f (,~p[,~l .p,n2) +f(op[,,,ul 4') f(v,p,n2)T f(nl,p,n2)+ f( v,n,p) (2) or, RA(v,nl,1),n2 ) = f ( vvl v ,p) + f ( ,:vl,~ ~ ,P )+ f ( \"ph),n 2 ) f(v,p)T f(nl ,p)+ f(p,n2) (3) To avoi(l using very low frequen(:ies, we set two thr('sholds for each one above. For triplecombimttion, the c(mdition is: fl, riple(v,Itl,1),n2 ) ~ 2, and 12*RA(v,nl,p,n2)-ll * h)g(ftrip>(v,nl,p,n2)) < 0.5 here, flriple(v,Ill,p,n2) = f(v,1),n2)+f(nl,t),n2)+f(v,nl,1) ) For 1)airs-(:oml)ination, the condition is: fpair(v,nl,p,n2) > 4, and 12*RA(v,nl,p,n2)-I I * log(fp,,i,.(v,ul,p,n2)) < 0.5 here, fpair(v,nl,1),n2 ) = f(v,p)+f(nl,p)+f (p,n2) With the first threshohl in ca,oh case, we can avoid using low frequency tul)les; with the second one in each case, we throw away the RA score which is close to 0.5 ~Ls tlfis wdue is rather unstabh,. Conceptual Information and Preference Rules As we use only \"relial)le\" data from corl)ora to make decision on PP atta('hlnellt based (m RA score, many PPs' attachlnents may be left undetermined due to sparse. (l;tta. We deal these undete.rlnined PPs with a rule-based approach. Here we use preference rules to determine PP attachments 1)y judging features of head words and conceptual relationships among them. Tl,is information comes from a machine-readable dictionary EDR dictionary, s SEDII electronic dietionm'y consists of a set of machine-readable dictionaries which includes Japanese and English word dictionary, Japanese and English co-occurrence dictionary, concept dictionary, and Jal)anese < > English l)ilingual dletionary(EI)R 1993). Features and Concept Classes We cluster words (verbs or nouns) ~hi~h have s~une feature or syntactical function into a (:()ncel)t class. For examI)le, we classify verbs into active and passive, and ontologicM cbusses of mental, movement, etc. Similarly, we group nouns into place, time, state, direction, etc. We extract eoncel)t (:lass from concept classification in EDR Concept Dictionary} ~ Conceptual Relationship Conceptual relationships between v and n2, or between nl and n2 predict PP attaehnlent quite well in many eases. We use EDR concept dictionary to acquire the concel)tual relationship between two concet)ts. For examt)le, given the two concet)ts of open and key, the dictionary will tell us that there may be a implement relationship 1)etween them, means that key may be act its an instrument for the action open. Preference Rules We introduce 1)reference rules to encode syntactic and lexical clues, as well a~s clues from conceptual information to determine PP attachments. We divide these rules into two categories: a rule whi('tl (:nit be applied to most of 1)rel)ositions is cMled global rule; a rule tying to a particular prel)osition, on the other hand, is called local rule. Four global rules used in our disambiguatioi: module are listed in Table 1 .   On the left hand of each rule, a one-atonl pre(t-Concet)t Dictionm'y consists of al)out 400,000 con: cepts, where, fbr eolleet)t classification, related coneepts are orgmfized in hierm'chieM ar('hitecture and a concept in h)wer level inherits the f~atures from its upper level concepts. lexical(passivized(v) + )lement(v, :)2) -> Vl)_~tttach(Pl )) (a-ol)jeet(nl, n2) ()R possessor(nl, 112)) AND NOT(implen:ent(v, n2)) -> np_~tttach(PP) Default -> vi)_attach(PP) icate Oil the left hand presents tt subclass of concept ill the eon(:ept hierarchy (e.g. tilne(n2)), and a two-atom 1)redicate describes the COlWei)t relation between two at (nns (e.g. implennult(v,n2) ). Since local rules emph)y the senses of head words (termed as concepts), we shouhl 1)roject each of v, ul and n2 used by rules into one or several coi|cepts which denote(s) \"correct\" word senses before apl)lying local rules. The process is described in (Wu and Furugori 1995) . Disambiguation Module For each sentence with aml)igu<)us PP (both ill syntaeti(' and semantie;d level), PETE system will produ<'e ;t structure with unattached PP(s), and call the disambiguation 1nodule to resolve ambiguous PP(s). The algorithm used in the nn)(hfle is shown beh)w : [ALGORITHM] Phase 1. (disambiguation using gh)bal rules): Try global rules one 1)y one. If a rule succeeds, use it to decide the attachment, and exit. Phase 2. (statistiesd)ased dismnbiguation): 1) Project each of v, nl, n2 into its COIteel)t sets. RA(v,nld),n2 ) = -1 (initial value) ftriple(v,nl,1),lt2 ) : f(v,p,:t2)+f(nl,1),n2)Tf(v,nl,p) fpair(v,Ill,t),n2 ) = f(v,1))+f(nl,1))+f(p,ll2 ) if ftriph,(v,nl,i),n2 ) > 2, then ll A(vdil,1),n2) = .f(vvl~,,r,.2)+.r( ~,~,1,, 1 ,v,-~)q.f(,,v[ ,,,~, :' a,) f( v,v,n 2)-b f(~ t ,p,~ 2).4-f( v ,.. 4>) if [2*RA(v,n 1,1),n2 )-11 *log(fi.riple( v ,n1,1),n2 ) ) <0.5 then RA(v,nl,p,n2) =-1 if RA(v, 2) Try the rules related to the prel)osition , if only one rule is applicable, use it to decide the attachment, and then exit. This algorithm differs from the previous one de.scribed ill (Wu and Furugori 1995) in which preference rules were applied 1)efol'e statistical computing. We have changed the order for the following reasons: an experinlent has proven that using the data of qua(lrul)les and triples, as well as tut)les with high occurrences i,s good enough in success rate (Sec Tal)lc 3). and statistic models ha,ve a ground m~themlttical 1)asis. Experiment and Evaluation We did an exl~eriment to test our lnethod. First, we prcl)are(l test data of 3043 ambiguous PPs in texts randomly taken from a (:Olnl)uter manual, a. graalllnlar book and Japan Time.s. The results are shown ill Table 3 .
