    "article": "Finding authentic examples of grammatical constructions is central in constructionist approaches to linguistics, language processing, and second language learning. In this paper, we address this problem as an information retrieval (IR) task. To facilitate research in this area, we built a benchmark collection by annotating the occurrences of six constructions in a Swedish corpus. Furthermore, we implemented a simple and flexible retrieval system for finding construction occurrences, in which the user specifies a ranking function using lexical-semantic similarities (lexicon-based or distributional). The system was evaluated using standard IR metrics on the new benchmark, and we saw that lexical-semantical rerankers improve significantly over a purely surface-oriented system, but must be carefully tailored for each individual construction. Introduction Linguistic theories based on the notion of constructions are a recent development in linguistics, which has revitalized the discussion in fields such as syntax, lexicography, and argument structure theory. In particular, it is useful for describing partially schematic constructions: templatic patterns that exhibit lexical as well as syntactic properties, which are too specific to be referred to general grammar rules, but too general to be attributed to specific lexical units, which is a reason why they historically have been overlooked (Fillmore et al., 1988) . These constructions are very frequent, and they are not only theoretically interesting but also important in language teaching (De Knoop and Gilquin, 2016) , since they are challenging for second language learners (Prentice and Sk\u00f6ldberg, 2011) . So far, despite the importance of construction-based theory in linguistics and language pedagogy, it has seen limited adoption in natural language processing. A major impediment to their acceptance is probably the lack of resources of a nontrivial size. Efforts to build inventories of this kind -constructiconsare now underway for a number of languages. The emerging practice of constructicon development, or constructicography, can be seen as a combination of construction grammar and lexicography (Fillmore et al., 2012) . A crucial requirement for constructicon building is access to corpus search tools allowing constructicographers to search for occurrences of constructions: either for finding prototypical examples (Gries, 2003) , or for computing statistics such as word-construction cooccurrence (Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2003) . Also, for the reasons mentioned above, finding authentic examples of uses of a particular construction is also useful in language teaching situations. In this paper, we cast the task of searching for construction occurrences as an information retrieval (IR) problem. This is fruitful in construction-based research and constructicography for a number of reasons. First, while a partially schematic construction can have a surface form that is easy to describe as a structural pattern, its exact semantic properties and restrictions can be hard to capture as a clearcut binary decision, or may not even be known a priori. This makes it natural to re-rank corpus hits according to a semantics-based scoring function. Such an approach allows a researcher to explore the spectrum of search hits, from the most prototypical -which a good retrieval system should place near the top -to the more unusual cases. Also, the IR perspective is natural in terms of interaction: a user can pose queries, rank and re-rank repeatedly according to different functions defined on the fly, to get a comprehensive overview of the various uses of a construction in a corpus. To open up new opportunities for research in construction retrieval, we built a benchmark collection by annotating the occurrences of six different partially schematic constructions defined in the Swedish Constructicon (Sk\u00f6ldberg et al., 2013) . This allows us to explore different retrieval systems and evaluate them according to standard IR evaluation protocols, and we developed a construction retrieval system that finds occurrences of partially schematic constructions in Swedish corpora, based on flexible user-defined ranking functions using lexicon-based and distributional similarities to describe the construction's slot fillers. These ranking functions are learned from a small number of seed examples. Our results show that ranking functions based on lexical-semantic properties are effective, outperforming a purely surfacebased baseline for all six constructions. However, because the constructions are so structurally and semantically diverse, we cannot expect a single ranking function to be the best in all cases, and in practice we observed considerable difference among constructions as to which similarities are most useful. This shows that it is crucial for the ranking functions to be flexible and user-defined, which also makes most sense from a usability perspective. Construction Grammar and the Swedish Constructicon In terms of linguistic theory, the approach is couched in Construction Grammar, for which the aforementioned abundance of semi-general and partially schematic patterns is a key motivation, and where intermingling of linguistic levels is seen as the norm, not the exception. Rejecting the sharp distinction between lexicon and grammar, constructionists regard grammatical rules, lexical idiosyncrasies and \"mixed\" patterns alike as constructions: \"conventional, learned form-function pairings at varying levels of complexity and abstraction\" (Goldberg 2013, p17) . A methodological benefit of assuming the same kind of unit across the board is that the machinery required to account for patterns with both grammatical and lexical properties can also handle those that are purely grammatical or purely lexical, another that the absence of distinct levels eliminates the problem of borderline cases (Fillmore et al., 1988) . Applying this view to descriptive practice, a constructicon is a collection of construction descriptions, a \"dictionary of constructions.\" First introduced for English (Fillmore et al., 2012) , there are now constructicon resources under development for a number of languages, including Swedish (Sk\u00f6ldberg et al., 2013; Lyngfelt et al., forthcoming), Brazilian Portuguese (Torrent et al., 2014) , and Japanese (Ohara, 2013) . The Swedish Constructicon currently covers around 400 constructions, many of which are partially schematic patterns of the kind that is hard to account for from a grammatical or lexical perspective alone. Hence, offering a wide and relevant selection of constructions, it provides a suitable testing ground for the study at hand. To exemplify the organization of the Swedish Constructicon, Figure 1 shows the most important parts of its entry for V REFL.R \u00d6RELSE (REFLEXIVE MOTION), a frequent construction in which motion is expressed using a verb with a reflexive pronoun. The entry contains a definition of the construction, that presents its structure and semantics textually, a structure sketch describing its surface structure in a semi-formal way, and a small number of annotated examples from corpora that show typical uses of the construction.  3 Related work While we are aware of no previous work approaching the general problem of searching for construction occurrences from a retrieval perspective, quantitative and corpus-based methods have been a crucial part of the construction-linguistic toolbox from its early days (Gries, 2003; Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2003; Hilpert, 2013) . In particular, a number of automatic methods have been presented that mine corpora for frequent patterns. For instance, Wible and Tsao (2010) collected generalized n-grams (that is, combinations of words, PoS tags and phrase labels) and applied standard measures of collocational strength to select n-grams that seem to be recurrent patterns. The Swedish constructicon project used similar methods (Forsberg et al., 2014) , but also extended the approach by Wible and Tsao (2010) by considering patterns containing phrase labels (e.g. NP-and-NP, as-Adj-as-NP). The only related work we found that treats the construction detection as a ranking task is by Dubremetz and Nivre (2015) , who used a ranking approach to retrieve occurrences of the rare rhetorical chiasmus construction. They preferred ranking over classification since the complexity of this construction and the number of borderline cases made a hard classification infeasible, and similarly to our position, they argued that the existence of borderline cases should be embraced instead of ignored. However, since their work is limited to searching for just chiasmi, their system was completely tailored for this case. A benchmark collection for evaluating construction retrieval systems We built a new benchmark for evaluating construction retrieval systems based on six different constructions defined in the Swedish Constructicon. The selected constructions are nontrivial in the sense that their formal description cannot be translated into a standard corpus search query (based on surface features such as words or part-of-speech tags) that captures exactly their true instances -for instance, occurrences of the well-studied let alone construction (Fillmore et al., 1988) are easy to spot in corpora. The initial pass of creating the benchmark was to extract a collection of potential instances for each of the six constructions. We extracted these instances by querying the Korp corpus search engine, hosted by the Swedish Language Bank (Borin et al., 2012) . Korp stores a large collection of corpora, currently around 10 billion tokens, and allows structural queries based on surface strings but also several types of linguistic annotation; for this experiment, we used a corpus of contemporary fiction. The web service of Korp allows users to pose queries using the CQP language (Christ, 1994) , and we selected the instances by translating the structure sketch (as in the example in Figure 1 ) of each construction into a corresponding CQP query. The corpus search engine then returns a (possibly very large) number of hits, and depending on the formal properties of the construction, fixed lexical content, variable tokens, or syntactic restrictions of particular slots, this list is 'contaminated' to some extent by unrelated hits. Each collection of hits was then annotated manually as true or false instances of the construction in question. Table 1 shows the number of hits for each query, and the number of true hits among them. Table 1 : Statistics for the benchmark. In the following, we detail the six constructions used to create the benchmark. 1 V av NP V av NP is a causal VP construction where the event or state expressed by the verb is caused by the bare noun following the preposition av 'of'. It includes both literal and metaphorical causative relations such as stinka av m\u00f6gel 'stink of mold' and d\u00f6 av skam 'die of shame' but the formal surface description V av NP BARE also catches phrasal verbs such as dra av moms 'subtract sales tax' and passive voice constructions like l\u00e4ses av flickor 'is read by girls'. The variable construction slots are not restricted to any obvious semantic classes, although emotions and physical states are clearly salient at first glance. PROPORTION i/om PROPORTION i/om is a rate construction that combines two entities, a numerator and a denominator, joined by the preposition i 'in' or om 'about', and is restricted to temporal relations such as frequency and speed, and salary rates also fit into this scheme. Its structure sketch NP INDEF [i | om] N DEF catches true instances such as tv\u00e5 g\u00e5nger om dagen 'two times a day' and \u00e5ttio pesos i m\u00e5naden 'eighty pesos a month', as well as false positives such as tio dagar i f\u00e4ngelset 'ten days in jail'. REFLEXIVE MOTION As mentioned in Section 2, REFLEXIVE MOTION is a self-motion construction where an actor expressed with a reflexive traverses a path in a direction from a place or towards a goal. The verb typically describes the means or manner of the motion, while the prepositional/adverbial phrase contributes the direction. The formal description V PN REFL [PP | ADVP] captures prototypical occurrences like s\u00e4tta sig ned 'sit down' and ta sig fram 'make one's way' as well as instances with verbs that do not usually indicate motion, like svetta sig igenom 'sweat one's way through' and l\u00e4sa sig bak\u00e5t 'read one's way backwards'. False hits in the search result include common reflexive verbs that do not express motion, like k\u00e4nna sig glad 'feel happy' and anf\u00f6rtro sig \u00e5t 'confide in' as well as certain lexicalized multiword expressions like tr\u00e4nga sig p\u00e5 'intrude' and s\u00e4tta sig p\u00e5 tv\u00e4ren 'be obstinate'. QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME The QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME construction is defined as a genitive modifier that specifies the duration of an activity. The formal description DET N GEN N INDEF captures true instances of the construction such as en stunds tystnad 'a moment's silence', but also the related scale construction fem meters djup 'five meter's depth' (described below), as well as other genitives like en m\u00e4nniskas skugga 'the shadow of a human'. QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE The scale construction QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE is the sibling of the time construction described above. Here, the genitive modifier specifies the value on a scale expressed by the noun phrase. It shares the formal description DET N GEN N INDEF with QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME but is semantically restricted to scalable measures like height, depth, age, size and other things that can be quantified. Consequently, the query captures true instances of the scale construction like tusen meters h\u00f6jd 'a thousand meter's height' and elva m\u00e5naders hyra 'eleven month's rent', but also instances of the aforementioned time construction tre timmars seglats 'three hour's sailing trip'. Again, other genitive phrases like en kvinnas fot 'the foot of a woman' also end up in the search batch. BOUNDED EVENT p\u00e5 The BOUNDED EVENT p\u00e5 construction is a time expression that modifies the duration in time of a completed action, expressed using the preposition p\u00e5, corresponding to the similar English construction using in. It is a specific and rather restricted instance of a more general pattern for prepositional time adverbials. The construction can only be used with events of bounded aspect, and thereby specifies the time required to complete the event. A related but separate construction is used for negated events, where time adverbials with p\u00e5 can be used to describe the duration that has passed since an event took place; this construction is called SPECIFIED TIME:POLARITY. The structure sketch p\u00e5 NP naturally translates to a search query that captures all prepositional phrases with the preposition p\u00e5, and even though the noun slot is strictly restricted to time expressions it is impossible to delimit it from related time constructions without taking the wider context into account. The search hits include true instances of the construction such as rummet t\u00f6mdes p\u00e5 n\u00e5gra sekunder 'the room was emptied in a few seconds' as well as false instances like the negative construction ingen hade samlat ved p\u00e5 ett \u00e5r 'nobody had been collecting firewood for a year'. However, most of the answer set consists of typical PPs like p\u00e5 en stol 'on a chair'. Construction retrieval with lexical-semantic reranking The new benchmark allows us to investigate and compare different systems for retrieving occurrences of constructions in corpora. We now describe the implementation of a retrieval system for finding occurrences of constructions: in particular, we discuss how the ranking function is defined, including the various lexical-semantic similarities the user can choose from, and how the ranking function is trained from a few user-selected seed examples. The system is built on top of the corpus search service Korp, described in Section 4. This is the most comprehensive service of this kind for Swedish, but any similar search tool could be used if building a similar retrieval system for other languages. As when creating the benchmark, the first step of searching for occurrences is to call the underlying corpus search system with a query that describes the surface form of the construction (corresponding to the structure sketch in Figure 1 ). For instance, if we are looking for occurrences of the QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME construction (e.g. an hour's rest), we use a query corresponding to its structure sketch DET N GEN N INDEF . A number of hits are then returned, out of which some are instances of the construction we are looking for, while others are unrelated. For instance, the structural pattern mentioned above will match any genitive, such as a dog's life. To address this problem, we apply a reranking function. The user is asked to provide the system with two additional types of information: (1) a number of positive seed examples of sentences containing true instances of the construction she is looking for and ( 2 ) what linguistic properties to consider for particular slots in the search string. For instance, a user could say that the ranking function should consider the distributional similarity function based on the second word in the hit, e.g. the time word in the example above, and then select a number of occurrences such as an hour's rest, three years' study. With a carefully designed ranking function and representative seed examples, the system can rank time/activity expressions above other expressions matching that surface pattern. Training the reranking function The reranker is a scoring function R(x) applied to each hit x returned by the corpus search. Learning rankers is widely studied in IR (Liu, 2009) ; in this work, we assume that each hit x can be analyzed using m different similarity functions \u03c3 j , selected by the user on the fly. Assuming there are labeled examples x 1 , . . . , x n , we write the ranker as R(x) = n i=1 m j=1 \u03b1 ij \u03c3 j (x, x i ) where \u03b1 ij is a weight representing the contribution of similarity \u03c3 j applied to the labeled example x i . If the \u03c3 j are valid kernels, this is the dual form of a linear scoring function, and the \u03b1 ij can be determined by training a kernelized learner such as the ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002) . We prefer to use a simpler learning method that is efficient and that works with just a few examples. For these reasons, we set the weights by computing the centroid of the positively labeled instances: that is, by setting all \u03b1 ij to 1/n. This method has trivial computation time and allows the use of any similarity function, not just kernels. More complex learners for this scenario, e.g. the one-class SVM (Manevitz and Yousef, 2001), may be considered in future work, and we could also imagine the weights being set manually by the users. Similarity functions used in the reranker The corpus search system takes care of basic surface-oriented features (word forms, morphology, grammatical functions and categories), so the central task of the reranker is to use representations of word meaning to go beyond the simple structural information. We investigate different measures: similarities based on hand-crafted lexicons, and distributional similarity computed from corpora. Network-based similarity SALDO (Borin et al., 2013) is a large lexical resource that connects senses of Swedish words into a hierarchical semantic network. To measure similarity between two SALDO entries, we use the measure by Wu and Palmer (1994) , based on proximity in the tree and the depth of the lowest common ancestor. This measure is a number between 1 and 0, where 1 is the score for two identical entries. A complication is that our corpora lacks sense annotation; however, since the first sense dominates overwhelmingly in corpora for most lemmas (Johansson et al., 2016) , we use the first sense to compute the similarities. Frame-based similarity An alternative lexicon-based similarity function is based on the Swedish FrameNet (Friberg Heppin and Toporowska Gronostaj, 2012) . This resource, similar to its English counterpart (Fillmore and Baker, 2009) , maps lemmas to one or more frames, which for the current purposes can be seen as semantic classes. Intuitively, two words have a similar meaning if they belong to the same frame; for instance, timme 'hour' and minut 'minute' are related because they both belong to the frame CALENDRIC UNIT. Again, we have to deal with the lack of word sense annotation in the corpora, so we define the similarity to be 1 if the two words share at least one frame, and 0 otherwise. Distributional similarity In a distributional model (Turney and Pantel, 2010), the meaning representation of a word is computed by observing the contexts in which it appears in a corpus. This is represented as a vector, which makes it possible to apply geometric operations -most importantly, to compute a word similarity by using a function such as the cosine. We trained word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) on a 1-billion mixed corpus, preprocessed by lemmatization and compound splitting. We used the default settings, except the dimensionality which was set to 512. To compute the similarity between two words, we applied the cosine to their lemma vectors. 2 Again, this similarity is at most 1, which happens if the vectors are identical. Experiments We first investigated the effect of the choice of lexical similarity. Table 2 shows the average precision scores for three different similarities: Wu-Palmer in SALDO, frame-based, and distributional. As a baseline we include a lemma-based similarity corresponding to a simple search with a number of specified lemmas in the variable construction slots (that is, we get exactly what we asked for and nothing else). As seed examples, the rerankers were trained on the first 15 positively labeled instances in the collection. The result clearly shows that reranking based on a lexical-semantic model can give very strong improvement over the lemma-based baseline. However, it should be noted that there is considerable variation in the result. For instance, for PROPORTION i/om and QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME, the framebased reranker outperforms the others significantly. As we will see in the detailed analysis, a likely explanation is that the slot fillers in these constructions have well-defined semantic restrictions that correspond cleanly to FrameNet frames, in particular time-related words (frames such as Calendric unit and Measure duration). In the case of V av NP, QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE and BOUNDED EVENT p\u00e5 it is instead the distributional model that works best. The distributional model seems to work best when the slot fillers are not restricted to a narrowly defined semantic class (corresponding to a FrameNet frame), but instead belong to a broader semantic domain, like emotional states for V av NP. The network-based lexicon similarity does better than the baseline in most cases, but never outperforms the other similarities. It is difficult to speculate about why, but we can at least conclude that FrameNet frames are better at capturing narrowly defined semantic classes and distributional models do better at generalizing beyond taxonomic similarity scores. Qualitative evaluation We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the system by analyzing each construction search separately. The reranked instances were inspected with a particular focus on false positives, which are telling indicators of the shortcomings of our approach. We will also inspect the lower regions of the reranked list and say something about false negatives -true occurrences that end up near the bottom of the reranked search list. This qualitative evaluation is telling, since it may also exemplify how a constructicographer would describe delimiting characteristics of specific constructions. V av NP We expected the V av NP construction (e.g. rodna av ilska 'blush with anger') to be a hard nut to crack because of its great productivity and high lexical variation, but the distributional similarity performs beyond expectations. In particular, this model succeeds in generalizing beyond seen instances and gives high ranking scores to a wide array of new and creative occurrences of the V av NP construction. Although there are no distinct semantic restrictions on the variable slots of the V av NP constructions, the state or event caused by the noun is typically physical or emotional. Representative verbs include darra 'shiver', lida 'suffer', d\u00f6 'die', gr\u00e5ta 'cry', rodna 'blush', sk\u00e4lva 'quiver', kvida 'whimper', fl\u00e5sa 'pant' and skaka 'shake'. The noun slot is typically occupied by event nouns such as raseri 'rage', sm\u00e4rta 'pain', anstr\u00e4ngning 'exertion', \u00e4ngslan 'anxiety', migr\u00e4n 'migraine', f\u00f6r\u00e4lskelse 'infatuation' and upphetsning 'excitement'. The distributional model excels in finding commonalities between these words, while the frame-based similarity is too restricted. The slot fillers display so much lexical variation that the frame-semantic lexicon manages to capture just a fraction of them. PROPORTION i/om As mentioned above, it is hardly surprising that the search system is good at detecting the PROPOR-TION i/om construction or that the best performing similarity feature in this case is frame-based. The rate construction (e.g. tre g\u00e5nger om dagen 'three times a day') is strictly restricted to temporal relations, so the denominator will always be a time-related word belonging to a few well-defined frames. REFLEXIVE MOTION The evaluation results for REFLEXIVE MOTION (e.g. pressa sig ut 'press oneself out') are unimpressive. None of the rankers are particularly good at detecting this construction: the frame-based reranker just barely beats the baseline. When inspecting the results, it seems that there is too much diversity in this set, with creative metaphors frequently used, for the lexical models to be very effective. On a lighter note, while this construction is diverse, we observed that some subsets of the occurrences can be handled nicely: if we are particularly interested in occurrences of the REFLEXIVE MOTION construction where the verb has a more specific manner meaning, we can handpick seed examples of that kind. By doing so, sentences like (1) rise to the top of the answer set. This means that even if the overall score is low, the user can still use the search system productively to find a certain important subclass. ( For the time construction QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME (e.g. tv\u00e5 timmars vila 'two hours' rest'), the frame-based reranker clearly outperforms the other similarity functions in this case since the construction is restricted to time expressions, which we have already seen fit neatly into a few particular frames. Since time expressions are such a strong feature for detecting this construction, it comes as no surprise that false positives near the top of the ranked list contain time words as well. Example (2) is a false hit that is in fact an instance of the superficially similar QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE construction. ( The lexical similarities give a smaller improvement for the QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE than for the related time construction. In particular, while the frame-based feature worked best for the time construction, it receives the lowest average precision in this case. The scalable measures that turn up here are diverse and do not seem to correspond neatly with FrameNet frames. The distributional similarity does best at generalizing beyond seen examples, and quite impressively hands out high ranking scores to instances as diverse as 50 procents chans '50 percent chance', tv\u00e5 veckors sk\u00e4ggstubb 'two weeks' stubble' and tre spalters bredd 'three columns' width'. The precision starts to drop when false hits from the QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME construction and other constructions start to appear. BOUNDED EVENT p\u00e5 Even though this construction (e.g. p\u00e5 tv\u00e5 timmar 'for two hours') is strictly restricted to time related words, the frame-based reranker performs worst in the evaluation. The explanation is quite straightforward; just spotting the time word is not enough to disambiguate BOUNDED EVENT p\u00e5 from related time constructions: most of the information that could be used to discriminate can be found outside of the hit. Recall that BOUNDED EVENT p\u00e5 only occurs with events of bounded lexical aspect. Since we had little hope that the reranker would be effective for such a contextually dependent construction as BOUNDED EVENT p\u00e5, it is a pleasant surprise to see that the distributional model is doing significantly better than the baseline. A possible explanation is that there are lexical preferences at play, beyond the more general time restriction. Short time spans like p\u00e5 ett \u00f6gonblick 'in an instant' seem more likely to be instances of this construction than cases such as p\u00e5 en s\u00f6ndag 'on a Sunday'. Among the top-ranked false positives, we find quite a few hits with the lexicalized phrase p\u00e5 en g\u00e5ng 'at once'. Introducing more contextual information seems necessary for dealing successfully with a construction like this one. However, in this particular case it is not entirely clear how to determine the lexical aspect of the event in an automated fashion. A more straightforward feature to introduce would be negations that can be relatively easily spotted by using a list of negative polarity items. Discussion We considered the problem of searching for occurrences of a grammatical construction as a retrieval problem, and we created a new benchmark collection with annotated examples for six different constructions defined by the Swedish constructicon. This new resource allows us to investigate the effectiveness of different retrieval models. As a proof of concept, we presented a simple interactive architecture for searching for constructions, where a user provides a number of positive examples (occurrences of the construction) and tailors a ranking function based on a user-defined combination of features, and our benchmark enabled us to carry out detailed quantitative and qualitative investigations of the effect of different models of lexical representation on the retrieval performance of this system. All our experiments were carried out using Swedish, because of the availability of the Swedish Constructicon used to select the constructions in the benchmark, but our approach is general and could be ported to other languages, including English: similar corpus search tools and lexical resources are readily available. As expected, grammatical constructions are diverse and the ranking function must be tailored for each construction. The most consistent result is that lexical-semantic models based on a constructions' slot fillers improve the reranker, but exactly which of them -lexicon-based or distributional -is most effective depends on the construction. It is important to note that the accuracy of the reranker depends on the construction definition and to which extent such semantic restrictions are in fact at play. The system should therefore be useful in the work of characterizing and defining constructions. As we have already pointed out in the text, there are several ways to extend this work: more complex learning algorithms for the rankers could be considered, or we could make use of information beyond the slot fillers of the construction. Also, we have now studied the retrieval problem in isolation, but since our main motivation is that the system should be used in the practical work of linguists working with construction grammar, it would be interesting to investigate the usability and interaction aspect as well.
