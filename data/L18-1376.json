Japanese is known to be rich in compound verbs consisting of two verbs joined together. However, we did not have a comprehensive Japanese compound lexicon. Recently a Japanese compound verb lexicon was constructed by the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics(NINJAL) . Though it has meanings, example sentences, syntactic patterns and actual sentences from the corpus that they possess, it has no information on relationships with another words, such as synonymous words and phrases. We automatically extracted synonymous expressions of compound verbs from corpus which is \"five hundred million Japanese texts gathered from the web\" produced by Kawahara et.al. (2006)  by using word2vec and cosine similarity and find suitable clusters which correspond to meanings of the compound verbs by using k-means++ and PCA. The automatic extraction from corpus helps humans find not only typical synonyms but also unexpected synonymous words and phrases. Then we manually compile the list of synonymous expressions of Japanese compound verbs by assessing the result and also link it to the \"Compound Verb Lexicon\" published by NINJAL. Introduction In this work, we deal with Japanese verbs and in particular, those of the compound variety. Japanese \"Verb+Verb\" compounds frequently appear in daily communication which is related to human actions. In terms of morphology, Japanese compounds involving verbs and other predicates are productive and widespread in both syntactic and lexical domains. We have started to construct a database of synonymous expressions of Japanese \"Verb + Verb\" compounds semi-automatically. Recently the Japanese compound verb lexicon was constructed by the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL) . It has meanings, example sentences, syntactic patterns and actual sentences from the corpus that they possess. However, it has no relationship information with another words, such as synonymous words and phrases. We try to detect them automatically as much as possible in order to help humans find not only typical synonyms but also unexpected synonymous words and phrases and manually compile a lexicon of synonymous expressions of Japanese compound verbs. We conducted three actions, 1) extract synonymous expressions (words and phrases) from corpus by using word2vec and cosine similarity measure, 2) classify synonymous expressions into several clusters by using the clustering method k-means++ (Arthur and Vassilvitskii 2009) and 3) find a suitable number of clusters corresponding to the meanings of each compound verb by PCA and compile a list of synonymous expressions and their semantic classes by assessing them manually. Compound verbs that we treat Japanese compound verbs consist of two verbs joined together. The morphological form is a combination of the first verb in an adnominal form and the second verb coming after it, as in hikari (adnominal form)-kagayaku (give.off.light & shine) 'shine like the sun', nage (adnominal form)-ireru (throw & put.in) 'throw in'. These compound verbs are divided into two types in terms of syntactic and morphological analysis ; syntactic compound verbs and lexical compound verbs (Kageyama 1993) . Kageyama(1993) says that syntactic compound verbs are easily recognizable and interpretable due to some characteristics, that is, a limitation of the variety of second verbs, no restriction on the first verbs and so on. We exclude the syntactic compound verbs and treat only lexical compounds which tightly combine two verbs as one word and also not productive than syntactic compound verbs Related Researches So far, NLP domain researches on complexed verbal meaning have treated multi word expressions in order to distinguish a literal meaning with the metaphoric meaning, but their purposes are word sense disambiguation or thegeneration of compounding words (Sag et.al.2002; Katz and Giesbrecht2006; Hashimoto and Kawahara 2008 and so on) . In Japanese, Uchiyama and Ishizaki (2003) , and Uchiyama and Baldwin (2004) investigated the ambiguities of compound verbs and tried to discover the rules for generation, but the number of compound verbs that they treated was insufficient. As a research on predicative verbs, which was not limited to compound verbs, Izumi et.al (2013) proposed the recognition of semantically equivalent predicate phrases by using definitions in a dictionary and several thesauri as features of verbs. They showed a good result in their experiment, however, in our research, compound verbs that we deal with are not always registered on those lexicons. We have to explore possible methods to find similar expressions of words from corpus. Data We use \"five hundred million Japanese texts gathered from the web\" produced by Kawahara et.al. (2006) as corpus for extracting synonymous words and phrases. For compound verbs, we treated compound verbs registered in the \"Compound Verb Lexicon (CVL)\" created by the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL). The total number of compound verbs in this lexicon is 2700, and each compound verb has meanings, syntactic patterns and example sentences. We also utilized it for an assessment. Extraction of synonym candidates of each Compound Verb We utilized word2vec (Mikolov, 2013) , one of the deep learning methods, for the vectorization of words. The learning model of word2vec that we used is CBOW (Contiguous Bag of Words) and the range of window is five words. We estimate w(t), a word located in position \"t\" in a sentence, due to two words each before and after w(t) (that is, w(t-2), w(t-1), w(t+1), and w(t+2)). In our experiment, we vectorized all of the 2700 compound verbs with word2vec by using the five hundred million Japanese web corpus and extracted synonyms of 2700 compound verbs based on this vectorization. Step (1): preprocessing In the first trial, we simply put the output of the morphological analyzer JUMAN into word2vec, however, the result was unsatisfactory. Consequently, we decided to utilize syntactic information for the input data. Syntactic information means the case relations between verbs and nouns extracted from web corpus by KNP parser. The sets of a noun, a verb and a case marker consist of the input data for word2vec. We needed to treat phrasal expressions as \"verbs\", because some compound verbs can be paraphrased into phrases. We concatenated modification relations between verbs and adverbial words and made units which we treated as \"verbs\" (e.g. correctly / understand \uf0e0 \"correctly understand\"). Step (2): vectorization and similarity We performed then vectorization of all verbs and nouns in the web corpus by using word2vec and explored the semantic distance between verbs (including verbal phrases) by cosine similarity. For each compound verb, the verb and verbal phrases were arranged in descending order from the highest score. Step (3): list creation For each compound verb in the CVL, 2000 similar expressions were chosen in order of the highest score of cosine similarity. Here, the lists of synonymous expressions for each compound verb were created. However, in this list, the polysemy of compound verbs was not taken into account. That is, the synonymous expressions of compound verbs were stored together without distinction of polysemous meaning in this list. Getting Clusters for a Compound verb In order to identify each of the polysemous meanings we classify synonymous expressions for each compound verb by using the clustering method k-means++ and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Pearson 1901). Our procedure is shown in detail in Figure 1 below. Figure1: the process of obtaining polysemous clusters Step(4):choosing 100 synonymous expressions In order to select a suitable clustering method, we compared the results obtained by hierarchical clustering and k-means++. For the hierarchical clustering, we adopted Ward's method. k-means++ is a partial optimization clustering of k-means developed by Arthur and Vassilvitskii (2007) , and its initialization method is improved. Comparing the results, these methods both had advantages and disadvantages, and the plausibility of classification of synonymous expressions is similar, however, we chose k-means++ in this work because it found some unexpected expressions. At the beginning, each compound verb has 2000 synonymous expressions extracted from the web corpus. We needed to narrow down the number of expressions in order to detect the plausible synonymous expressions. Our idea is to decrease the number of expressions in a step-bystep approach by iterating the k-means++. The actual procedure is described below. 1. Firstly, we set 64 clusters for the k-means++. In this stage, 2000 expressions are classified into 64 clusters. 2. For each cluster, we extract 10 expressions with the highest similarity values in the list. In this stage, we narrow down to 640 expressions (64 clusters * 10 expressions). 3. We iterate the same process as step2 for the 640 expressions. In this stage, we set 10 clusters. As a result, we obtained 100 synonym expressions classified into10 clusters (10 clusters * 10 expressions). This data is then used as the input data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Step (5): Clustering by PCA We settled the 100 synonymous expressions classified into 10 clusters for each compound verb. However, the number of senses of a compound verb differs from each other .We tried to detect the appropriate numbers of senses of each compound verb by using PCA. We implemented PCA with 100 expressions for each compound verb. We manually found clusters from the result by PCA. In the scatter diagram we extracted clusters clearly separated from the groups of unrelated expressions that were gathered together. Evaluation for 40 compound verbs In order to predict how many suitable synonyms and clusters semi-automatically obtained by our method, we evaluate our results manually. For 40 compound verbs which are the most frequent compound verbs in our corpus, four examinees evaluated the suitability of the synonymous expressions classified in each cluster. We evaluated the expressions for each cluster by comparing them to sense descriptions of the compound verb in CVL. As a result, 59% of extracted words are evaluated as synonyms. Furthermore, we evaluated the suitability of clusters created by our method. We compared the clusters to sense descriptions of the compound verb in CVL. As a result, 65% of extracted clusters are evaluated as representing the proper meaning of the compound verb. For example, \"Furikaeru (Furu-+kaeru)\" has a single meaning like \"look behind with twisting body\" in CVL. Our method could extract another meaning, i.e. \"think back on the previous episode.\" Compound Verb A synonymX synonymM synonym S k-means++ PCA Cluster3 Cluster2 Cluster1 synonymX synonymS Step(4) Step( 5 ) In terms of recall, the total number of meanings of 40 compound verbs registered in CVL is 64. Among them 14 meanings could not be obtained by our methods (22%). These 14 meanings are included in 13 compound verbs. Our method could not extract proper clusters for two verbs among 40 verbs, i.e. \"toi-awaseru (make an inquiry)\" and \"sashi-dasu (holdout)\". Most of the candidates of synonymous expressions we extracted for these compound verbs were unsuitable. Manually Making a List of Synomymous Expressons from the Result of PCA From the result of PCA, we manually classify synonymous expressions into clusters, i.e. drawing circles in Fig. 2 . [Cluster 1] Meaning : overflow Synonymous expressions : \u3042 \u3075 \u308c \u308b (afureru, overflow), \u6e80 \u3061 \u6ea2 \u308c \u308b (michiafureru, bubble), \u5145\u6e80\u3059\u308b(juumansuru, be full of) ... [Cluster2] Meaning : crowded Synonymous expressions : \u6df7\u96d1\u3059\u308b(konzatsusuru, crowded), \u304b\u306a\u308a\u8fbc\u307f\u5408\u3046 (kanari komi-au, very crowded), \u7279\u306b\u8fbc\u3080(tokuni komu, extreamly congested), ... [Cluster3] Meaning : go all quiet Synonymous expressions : \u6c34\u3092\u6253\u3063\u305f\u3088\u3046\u306b\u9759\u304b\u306b\u306a\u308b (mizu-wo uttayouni shizukani naru, become a complete silence as if someone can hear a pin drop.), \u304b\u3059\u304b\u306b\u6d41\u308c\u308b (kasukani nagareru, flow faintly) \u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u306b\u3042\u3075\u308c\u308b (ippaini afureru, full of and overflow), \u3042\u3075\u308c\u3066\u51fa\u308b (afurete deru, overflow and spill out) .. Expressions in Cluster3 are a mixture of anotonymous and synonymous expressions. There are antonymous expressions like \u6c34\u3092\u6253\u3063\u305f\u3088\u3046\u306b\u9759\u304b\u306b\u306a\u308b (mizu-wo uttayouni shizukaninaru, hush fell over) and \u304b\u3059\u304b\u306b\u6d41 \u308c\u308b (kasukani nagareru,, flow faintly) and also synonymous expressions like \u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u306b\u3042\u3075\u308c\u308b (ippaini afureru, full of and overflow) and \u3042\u3075\u308c\u3066\u51fa\u308b (afurete deru, overflow and spill out). That is, the expressions in Cluster 3 are not separated clearly. When we finally make a list of synonymous expressions, even if the synonymous expressions are classified into an unsuitable cluster, i.e. Cluster 3 in this case, we do not ignore such expressions but move them to a suitable cluster. In this case, we pick up the synonymous expressions \u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u306b\u3042\u3075 \u308c\u308b (ippaini afureru, full of and overflow) and \u3042\u3075\u308c\u3066 \u51fa\u308b (afurete deru, overflow and spill out) from Cluster3 and move them to a feasible cluster, in this case, Cluster1, manually. The list for \u3042\u3075\u308c\u304b\u3048\u308b (afurekaeru) that we finally obtain is : Compound Verb Lexicon compiled by NINJAL The list that we are now compiling will be linked to CVL in order to cover meanings that we fail to find and also extend the CVL. Compound Verb Lexicon (CVL) was constructed by the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL) . It says that comprising over 2,700 verb-verb compound verbs commonly used in contemporary Japanese, the Compound Verb Lexicon is designed to provide both researchers in linguistics and foreign learners of Japanese with useful information on their grammatical, semantic, and other linguistic features. In addition to Japanese representations, it offers English, Chinese, and Korean translations for the semantic definitions and example sentences. As an example, the description of \u3042 \u3075 \u308c \u304b \u3048 \u308b (afurekaeru) in CVL is as follows. Meaning: Japanese: \u5834\u6240\u306e\u53ce\u5bb9\u529b\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306b\u3001\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u3067\u3042\u308b\uff0e English: (Of a place) To be full beyond capacity.

English : There were huge crowds of people waiting for taxis in front of the station.

Syntactic pattern : N1-ni N1-ga afurekaeru N1-ga N2-de afurekaeru Link our List of Synonymous Expressions to CVL In our list, each cluster (cluster1, cluster2,..) corresponds to one of the meanings of each compound verb, therefore, in our list \u3042\u3075\u308c\u304b\u3048\u308b (afurekaeru) has two meanings (cluster1 and 2) and one antonymous meaning (cluster3). In CVL, this compound verb has one meaning, \"(Of a place) to be full beyond capacity\". CVL would be bundling cluster1 and cluster2 in our list by the same core meaning. However, in our result, synonym expressions in cluster 1 and those in cluster2 are clearly divided because they are used in a different context by figurative meaning. Actually, \"people are overflowing at the station\" is acceptable in Japanese, however, \"water was crowded\" is not acceptable. In our list, we keep two meanings, cluster1 (overflow) and cluster2 (crowded) and link cluster1 to the meaning \"(Of a place) to be full beyond capacity\" of \u3042 \u3075 \u308c \u304b \u3048 \u308b (afurekaeru) in CVL and, on the other hand, add Cluster2 as a new meaning. Future work We try to compile a list of synonymous expressions for about 2700 compound verbs registered in CVL and link to CVL so that we can find what kind of paraphrases compound verbs have. If we try to adopt our method to the construction of a large scale lexicon, it will consume significant time and human effort because the final step described in section 8 is manually conducted. In fact, it takes two people about one month to fully evaluate the result. For this task, the number of Japanese \" Verb + Verb\" compounds that we call \"lexical compound verbs\", not \"syntactic compound verbs\", is limited and they are not productive. Japanese VV lexical compound verbs are said to be about 3000 words, therefore our method can adopt to our task. For future work, although our result is interesting and is not bad, we intend to try another automatic method for the final clustering step instead of PCA. Japanese compound verbs are often tough obstacles for beginning learners of Japanese to work through. By linking synonym expressions to CVL, we would like to contribute to linguistic, NLP, and Japanese language education.",
