We argue that while discourse interpretation is an inferential process, syntactic cues constrain this process; we demonstrate this argument with respect to the interpretation of ZEROS, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in Japanese. The syntactic cues in Japanese discourse that we investigate are the morphological markers for grammatical TOPIC, the postposition wa, as well as those for grammatical functions such as SUBJECT, ga, OBJECT, o and OBJECT2, ni. In addition, we investigate the role of speaker's EMPATHY, which is the viewpoint from which an event is described. This is syntactically indicated through the use of verbal compounding, i.e. the auxiliary use of verbs such as kureta, kita. Our results are based on a survey of native speakers of their interpretation of short discourses, consisting of minimal pairs, varied by one of the above factors. We demonstrate that these syntactic cues do indeed affect the interpretation of ZEROS, but that having previously been the TOPIC and being realized as a ZERO also contributes to the salience of a discourse entity. We propose a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT, and show that CENTERING provides constraints on when a ZERO can be interpreted as the ZERO TOPIC. Introduction Centering in Japanese Discourse Recently there has been an increasing amount of work in computational linguistics involving the interpretation of anaphoric elements in Japanese (Yoshimoto 1988; Kuno 1989; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990; Nakagawa 1992 ). These accounts are intended as components of computational systems for machine translation between Japanese and English or for natural language processing in Japanese alone. This paper has three aims: (1) to generalize a computational account of the discourse process called CEN-TERING (Sidner 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished), (2) to apply this account to discourse processing in Japanese so that it can be used in computational systems, and (3) to provide some insights on the effect of syntactic factors in Japanese on discourse interpretation. In the computational literature, there are two foci for research on the interpretation of anaphoric elements such as pronouns. The first viewpoint focuses on an inferential process driven by the underlying semantics and relations in the domain (Hobbs 1985a; Hobbs et al. 1987; Hobbs and Martin 1987) . A polar focus is to concentrate on the role of syntactic information such as what was previously the topic or subject (Hobbs 1976b; Kameyama 1985; Yoshimoto 1988 ). We will argue for an intermediate position with respect to the interpretation of ZEROS, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in Japanese. Our position is that the interpretation of zeros is an inferential process, but that syntactic information provides constraints on this inferential process (Joshi and Kuhn 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981) . We will argue that syntactic cues and semantic interpretation are mutually constraining (Prince 1981b (Prince , 1985;; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988) . The syntactic cues in Japanese discourse that we investigate are the morphological markers for grammatical TOPIC, the postposition wa, as well as those for grammatical functions such as SUBJECT, ga, OBJECT, o, and OBJECT2, ni. In addition, we investigate the role of speaker's EMPATHY, which is the viewpoint from which an event is described. This can be syntactically indicated through the use of verbal compounding, i.e. the auxiliary use of verbs such as kureta, kita. In addition to the argument that a purely inference-based account does not consider limits on processing time, another argument against a purely inference-based account is provided by the minimal pair below. Here, the only difference is whether Ziroo is the subject or the object in the second utterance. Note that the interpretation of zeros is indicated in parentheses: Example 1 a. Taroo ga b. C. kooen o sanpositeimasita. Taroo SUBJ park in walking-was Taroo was taking a walk in the park. Ziroo ga 0 hunsui no mae de mitukemasita. Ziroo SUBJ OBJ fountain of front in found Ziroo found (Taroo) in front of the fountain. C. kooen o sanpositeimasita. Taroo SUBJ park in walking-was Taroo was taking a walk in the park. 0 Ziroo o hunsui no mae de mitukemasita. SUBJ Ziroo OBJ fountain of front in found (Taroo) found Ziroo in front of the fountain. 0 0 kinoo no siai no kekka o kikimasita. SUBJ OBJ yesterday of game of scores obj asked (Taroo) asked (Ziroo) the score of yesterday's game. In lb and 2b, the syntactic position in which Ziroo is realized has the effect that lc means Ziroo asked Taroo the score of yesterday's game, while 2c means Taroo asked Ziroo the score of yesterday's game. On the other hand, some purely syntactic accounts require that antecedents for zeros be realized as the grammatical TOPIC, and thus cannot explain the above example because Taroo is never explicitly marked as the topic (Yoshimoto 1988) . In the literature, ZEROS are known as zero pronouns. We adopt the assumption of earlier work that the interpretation of zeros in Japanese is analogous to the interpretation of overt pronouns in other languages (Kuroda 1965; Martin 1976; Kameyama 1985) . Japanese also has overt pronouns, but the use of the overt pronoun is rare in normal speech, and is limited even in written text. This is mainly because overt pronouns like kare ('he') and kanozyo ('she') were introduced into Japanese in order to translate gender-insistent pronouns in foreign languages (Martin 1976) . In this paper, we only consider zeros in subcategorized-for argument positions. Since Japanese doesn't have subject or object verb agreement, there is no syntactic indication that a zero is present in an utterance other than information from subcategorization) First, in Section 1.2 we describe the methodology that we applied in this investigation. In Section 2, we present the theory of centering and some illustrative examples. Then, in Section 3, we discuss particular aspects of Japanese discourse context, namely grammatical TOPIC and speaker's EMPATHY. We will show how these can easily be incorporated into a centering account of Japanese discourse processing, and give a number of examples to illustrate the predictions of the theory. We also discuss the way in which a discourse center is instantiated in Section 4. In Section 5 we propose a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT, and use the centering model to formalize constraints on when a zero may be interpreted as a ZERO TOPIC. Our account makes a distinction between two notions of TOPIC--grammatical topic and zero topic. The grammatical topic is the wa-marked entity, which is by default predicted to be the most salient discourse entity in the following discourse. However, there are cases in which it may not be, depending on whether ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT applies. This analysis provides support for Shibatani's claim that the interpretation of the topic marker, wa, depends on the discourse context (Shibatani 1990) . ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT actually predicts ambiguities in Japanese discourse interpretation and provides a mechanism for deriving interpretations that previous accounts claim would be unavailable. We delay the review of related research to Section 6 when we can contrast it with our account. The two major previous accounts are those of Kuno (Kuno 1972 (Kuno , 1976b (Kuno , 1987 (Kuno , 1989) ) and Kameyama (Kameyama 1985 (Kameyama , 1986 (Kameyama , 1988)) . Finally, in Section 7, we summarize our results and suggest topics for future research. Methodology Most of the examples in this paper are constructed as four utterance discourses that fit one of a number of structural paradigms. In all of the paradigms, a discourse entity is 1 When zero pronouns should be stipulated is still a research issue. For example, Hasegawa (1984) described a zero pronoun as a phonetically null element in an argument position. However, as shown in the following example, Terazu, Yamanasi, and Inada (1980) assumed that zero pronouns are not limited in their distribution and stipulated them in adjunct positions as well (Iida 1993) . Taroo wa Hanako no kaban o mitukemasita. Taroo TOP/SUBJ Hanako GEN bag OBJ found Taroo found Hanako\" s bag. introduced in the first utterance, and established by the second utterance as the CENTER, what the discourse is about. The manipulations of context occur with the third and the fourth utterances. In each case the zero in the third utterance cospecifies the entity already established as the center in the second utterance. The fourth utterance consists of a potentially ambiguous sentence containing two zeros. Thus we are manipulating factors such as whether a discourse entity is realized in subject or object position in the third utterance, whether a discourse entity realized in subject position is ga-marked or wa-marked in the third utterance, and whether a discourse entity realized in the fourth utterance in object position is marked as the locus of speaker's EMPATHY. We collected a group of about 35 native speakers by solicitation on the InterNet to provide judgments for most of the examples given in this paper. These native speakers were readers of the newsgroups sci.lang.japanese and comp.research.japan. They were thus typically well-educated, bilingual engineers. Whenever an example was tested in this way, we provide the number of informants who chose each possible interpretation to the right of the example. Some examples that are included for expository reasons were not tested. Participation in our survey was completely voluntary, and the data were collected over three surveys. Thus the numbers of subjects varied from one survey to another, and this is reflected in the numbers accompanying our examples. This data collection was carried out on written examples using electronic mail in a situation in which the informants could take as long as they wanted to decide which interpretation they preferred. The instructions sent with the surveys are given in Appendix A. This paradigm clearly cannot provide information on which interpretation a subject might arrive at first and then perhaps change based on other pragmatic factors, and thus it contrasts with reaction time studies. However, the judgments given should be stable and should reflect the fact that our informants were able to use all the information in the discourse. It is a useful paradigm given that we are exploring the correlation of syntactic cues and discourse interpretation. It has been claimed that syntactic cues are only used in automatic processing and can be overridden by deeper processing. However, Hudson's results suggest that subjects may judge a discourse sequence to be nonsensical when it is incoherent according to centering (Hudson-D'Zmura 1988) . Di Eugenio claims that discourse sequences in Italian that are not discourse-coherent according to centering theory produce a garden-path effect (Di Eugenio 1990) . The methods we used allow us to explore the results of these interactions, and yet it would be beneficial for these results to be expanded upon by careful psychological experimentation. For most of the examples reported here, we asked subjects to choose one preferred interpretation instead of allowing them to rank interpretations. The motivation for doing this was to force differences to come out for slight preferences, with the theory being that other variations would come out across subjects. In a few cases we allowed subjects to indicate no preference; these examples will be clearly indicated. In addition, we used the same gender for multiple discourse entities to prevent any tendency for judgments to be influenced by gender stereotypes. We also avoided using verbs with causal biases toward one of their arguments, and we used few cue words such as but, because, and then, which could result in a bias toward, say, a cause-effect or temporal sequence of events interpretation. We also omitted honorific markers, which are normally a part of Japanese ambiguity resolution. 2 This was done to isolate the effects of the variables that we were exploring in this study, namely topic marking, grammatical function, empathy, and realization with a zero or with a full noun phrase. Centering Theory Within a theory of discourse, CENTERING is a computational model of the process by which conversants coordinate attention in discourse (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished) . Centering has its computational foundations in the work of Grosz and Sidner (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1979; Grosz and Sidner 1986 ) and was further developed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, unpublished) and Joshi and Weinstein (1981) . Centering is intended to reflect aspects of ATYENTIONAL STATE in a tripartite view of discourse structure that also includes INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE and LINGUISTIC STRUC-TURE (Grosz and Sidner 1986) . In Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure, discourses can be segmented based on intentional structure, and a discourse segment exhibits both local and global coherence. Global coherence depends on how each segment relates to the overall purpose of the discourse; local coherence depends on aspects such as the syntactic structure of the utterances in that segment, the choice of referring expressions, and the use of ellipses. CENTERING models local coherence and is formalized as a system of constraints and rules. Our analysis uses an adaptation of the Centering algorithm that was developed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard, based on these constraints and rules (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker 1989) . The purpose of centering as part of a computational model of discourse interpretation is to model ATTENTIONAL STATE in discourse in order to control inference (Joshi and Kuhn 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981) . 3 Our approach to modeling attentional state is to explore aspects of the correlation between syntax and discourse function. This assumes that there are language conventions about discourse salience and that conversants attempt to maintain a sense of shared context. 2 While native speakers understandably found some of these examples \"stilted\" or \"awkward,\" they were still able to give their judgments based on the information that was provided in the discourses. 3 Recent work in situation theory proposes to control computation with a similar notion of background information in terms of constants of the situation that thus are not explicitly realized in an utterance (Nakashima 1990 ). The situation-theoretic work does not as yet distinguish shared knowledge that determines discourse salience and derives from the discourse context and the way utterances are expressed (Clark and Haviland 1977; Clark and Marshall 1981; Prince 1981b ) from shared knowledge that is part of general background knowledge such as cultural assumptions (Prince 1978a; Joshi 1982) or shared knowledge that might derive from the task context (Grosz 1977) . Section 2.1 presents the centering rules and constraints. Sections 2.2 and 2.3 illustrate the theory and the definitions with a number of examples. Section 2.4 discusses the centering algorithm for the resolution of zeros in Japanese. Rules and Constraints The centering model is very simple. Each utterance in a discourse segment has two structures associated with it. First, each utterance in a discourse has associated with it a set of discourse entities called FORWARD-LOOKING CENTERS, Cf. Centers are semantic entities that are part of the discourse model. Second, there is a special member of this set called the BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER, Cb. The Cb is the discourse entity that the utterance most centrally concerns, what has been elsewhere called the 'theme' (Reinhart 1981; Horn 1986 ). The Cb entity links the current utterance to the previous discourse. The set of FORWARD-LOOKING CENTERS, Cf, is ranked according to discourse salience. We will discuss factors that determine the ranking below. The highest-ranked member of the set of forward-looking centers is referred to as the PREFERRED CENTER, Cp. 4 The PREFERRED CENTER represents a prediction about the Cb of the following utterance. Sometimes the Cp will be what the previous segment of discourse was about, the Cb, but this is not necessarily the case. This distinction between looking back to the previous discourse with the Cb and projecting preferences for interpretation in subsequent discourse with the Cp is a key aspect of centering theory. In addition to the structures for centers, Cb and Cf, the theory of centering specifies a set of rules and constraints. Constraints are meant to hold strictly whereas rules may sometimes be violated. \u2022 CONSTRAINTS For each utterance Ui in a discourse segment UI~... ~ Um: . 2. . There is precisely one backward-looking center Cb. Every element of the forward centers list, Cf(Ui), must be realized in Ui. The center, Cb(Ui), is the highest-ranked element of Cf(Ui-D that is realized in Ui. 5 Constraint (1) says that there is one central discourse entity that the utterance is about, and that is the Cb. The second constraint depends on the definition of realizes. An utterance U realizes a center c if c is an element of the situation described by U, or c is the semantic interpretation of some subpart of U (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished) . Thus the relation REALIZE describes zeros, explicitly realized discourse entities, and those implicitly realized centers that are entities inferable from the discourse situation (Prince 1978a (Prince , 1981b)) . A specialization of the relation REALIZE is the relation DIRECTLY REALIZE. A center is directly realized if it corresponds to a phrase in an utterance. We restrict our focus to entities realized by noun phrases; however, it is clear that propositions can be centers, so we assume that the account given here can be extended to propositional entities as well (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Prince 1986 Prince , 1978b;; Ward 1985) . As we discuss further in Section 3, zeros refer to entities that are already in the discourse context. The fact that the current utterance REALIZES one or more zeros follows from information specified in the subcategorization frame of the verb. These arguments must be interpreted and thus acquire a degree of discourse salience that nonsubcategorized-for discourse entities lack. Constraint (3) stipulates that the ranking of the forward centers, Cf, determines from among the elements that are realized in the next utterance, which of them will be the Cb for that utterance. If the PREFERRED CENTER, Cp(Ui), is realized in Ui+l, it is predicted to be the Cb(Ui+l). We will use the following forward center ranking for Japanese: 6 (GRAMMATICAL OR ZERO) TOPIC > EMPATHY > SUBJECT > OBJECT2 > OBJECT > OTHERS Backward-looking centers, Cbs, are often deleted or pronominalized and some transitions between discourse segments are more coherent than others. According to the theory of centering, coherence is measured by the hearer's inference load when interpreting a discourse sequence (Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished) . For instance, discourse segments that continue centering the same entity are more coherent than those that repeatedly shift from one center to another. These observations are encapsulated in two rules: . 2. RULES For each Ui in a discourse segment U1,..., Urn: If some element of Cf(Ui-l) is realized as a pronoun in Ui, then so is Cb(Ui). Transition states are ordered. CONTINUE is preferred to RETAIN is preferred to SMOOTH-SHIFT is preferred to  Rule (1) captures the intuition that pronominalization is one way to indicate discourse salience. It follows from Rule (1) that if there are multiple pronouns in an utterance, one of these must be the Cb. In addition, if there is only one pronoun, then that pronoun must be the Cb. For Japanese, we extend this rule directly to zeros, assuming that zeros in Japanese correspond to destressed pronouns in English. Rule (2) states that modeling attentional state depends on analyzing adjacent utterances according to a set of transitions that measure the coherence of the discourse segment in which the utterance occurs. Measuring coherence is based on an estimate of the hearer's inference load, but this measure must always be relative since there is no grammar of discourse. Thus methods for exploring these issues must use comparative measures of how some discourses are easier to process than others. Centering theory models this by stipulating that some transitions are preferred over others. The typology of transitions from one utterance, Ui, to the next is based on two factors: whether the backward-looking center, Cb, is the same from Ui-1 to Ui, and whether this discourse entity is the same as the preferred center, Cp, of Ui. 8 6 This ranking is consistent with Kuno's Empathy Hierarchies and with Kameyama's Expected Center Order (Kuno 1987; Kameyama 1985 Kameyama , 1988 ). This will be discussed in Section 6. We do not include discourse entities for verb phrases or other propositional entities in this ranking since we have not studied their contribution (but see Sidner 1979 , 1981 and Carter 1987) . 7 Smooth-shift was called shifting-1 by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) . 8 It is possible that restricting the relation between the Cb(Ui) and the Cb(Ui_l) to be coreference (equality) may be too strong. Future work should examine the role of shifts to functionally dependent entities or entities related by partially ordered set (POSET) relations to the previous Cb.  2. Cb(Ui) = Cb(Ui_l), or there is no Cb(Ui-1) Cb(Ui) = Cp(Ui) If both (1) and ( 2 ) hold then we are in a CONTINUE transition. The CONTINUE transition corresponds to cases where the speaker has been talking about a particular entity and indicates an intention to continue talking about that entity. 9 If (1) holds but (2) doesn't hold then we are in a RETAIN transition. RETAIN corresponds to a situation where the speaker is intending to SHIFT onto a new entity in the next utterance and is signalling this by realizing the current center in a lower ranked position on the Cf (examples follow below). If (1) doesn't hold then we are in one of the SHIFT states depending on whether or not (2) holds. This definition of transition states is summarized in Figure 1 (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987) . We will use the notation of Cb(Ui-1) = [?] for cases where there is no Cb(Ui-1). Section 4 will discuss center instantiation. The combination of the constraints, rules, and transition states makes a set of testable predictions about which interpretations hearers will prefer because they require less processing. For example, maximally coherent segments are those that require less processing time. A sequence of a CONTINUE followed by another CONTINUE should only require the hearer to keep track of one main discourse entity, which is currently both the Cb and the Cp. A single pronoun in an utterance is the current Cb (by Rule 1) and can be interpreted to cospecify the discourse entity realized by Cp(Ui-1) in one step (Constraint 3). The ordering of the Cf is the main determinant of which transition state holds between adjacent utterances. This means that the predictions of the theory are largely determined by the ranking of the items on the Cf. But there are many factors that can contribute to the salience of a discourse entity; among them are factors that we will not examine here such as lexical semantics, intonation, word-order, and tense. 1\u00b0 In this 9 A prediction made by the preference for CONTINUE is that intersentential antecedents for pronouns will be preferred over intrasentential candidates. This preference is one that distinguishes Centering for pronoun interpretation from the proposal made by Hobbs (1976a Hobbs ( , 1976b)) . However, this preference needs to be constrained further by the fact that sortal filters may rule out the Cp of the previous utterance as the current Cb. In this case the data suggest that perhaps intrasentential candidates should be preferred (Walker 1989). Carter explored this in his extension of Sidner's theory of local focusing (Carter 1987) . 10 See Hudson-D'Zmura (1988) for an examination of the role of lexical semantics in centering. paper we explore the influence of various syntactic factors, which we discuss in detail in Section 3. We will also examine the relative contribution of pronominalization and postposition marking in Section 5. We postulate that the Cf ordering will vary from language to language depending on the means the language provides for expressing discourse function. However much of this variation can be captured in the ranking of the Cf due to the modularity of the theory. In Sections 2.2 and 2.3 we will present some simple examples to motivate these definitions. In Section 2.4 we will present a slightly modified version of the centering algorithm (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987) . In the following discussion we assume that the centering rules and constraints and the notion of centering transition states have some cognitive reality (Brennan submitted; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988; Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993; Hudson-D'Zmura and Tanenhaus, 1995) . However, we make no claims about the cognitive reality of the centering algorithm that we discuss in Section 2.4. The Distinction between Continue and Retain This theory predicts preferences in the interpretation of utterances whose meaning depends on parameters from the discourse context. Thus if there are still multiple possibilities for interpretation after the application of all constraints and rules, the ordering on transitions applies, and CONTINUE interpretations are preferred (Rule 2). Indeed, many cases of the preference for one interpretation over another follow directly from the distinction between the transition states of CONTINUE and RETAIN. Let us look at a simple example. In the discourse segment in 3, the zero in the second sentence is understood as referring to Taroo, and not to Hanako. Remember that the interpretation of zeros is indicated with parentheses. Example 3 a. Taroo wa b. Hanako o eiga ni sasoimasita. Taroo TOP/SUBJ Hanako OBJ movie to invited Taroo invited Hanako to the movie. Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO, HANAKO] 0 itiniti-zyuu nani mo te ni tukimasendesita. SUBJ all-day anything even hand to attached-not (Taroo) could not do anything all day. Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO] In example 3, the Cf from 3a contains the discourse entity for Taroo as the first element and for Hanako as the second element. When the unexpressed argument is interpreted in 3b, the information from this Cf is used. Because the zero subject may REALIZE either Taroo or Hanako, both Constraint 3 and Rule 1 would be obeyed with either interpretation. 11 However by interpreting the zero as Taroo, Taroo is the Cb, and it is possible to get a preferred CONTINUE interpretation Taroo could not do anything all day. In this interpretation, Taroo is both the Cb(3b) and the Cp(3b). 11 The hypothesis that wa in 3a instantiates Taroo as the Cb will be discussed in Section 4. The Distinction between Smooth-Shift and Rough-Shift In example 4, we illustrate the difference between the transition states of ROUGH-SHIFT and SMOOTH-SHIFT. Remember that ROUGH-SHIFT is claimed to be less coherent than SMOOTH-SHIFT (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987) . In both cases the speaker has shifted the center to a different discourse entity. However, in the SMOOTH-SHIFT transition state, the speaker has indicated an intention to continue talking about the recently shifted-to entity by realizing that entity in a highly ranked Cf position such as subject, whereas no such indication is available with the ROUGH-SHIFT transition. The numbers shown to the right of an interpretation correspond to how many native speakers preferred that interpretation. Example 4 a. Taroo ga kooen de hon o yondeimasita. Taroo SUBJ park at book OBJ reading-was Taroo was reading a book in the park. Cb: [?] In example 4, the use of TOPIC marking in the phrase Ziroo wa of utterance (c) means that (c) is interpreted as a RETAINJ 2 Ziroo becomes the most highly ranked discourse entity for c, although Taroo is the Cb since Taroo was most highly ranked for utterance (b) (by Constraint 3). Then when we apply the Centering algorithm in (d), there are two candidates for the Cb(d) from the Cf(c), both Ziroo and Taroo. However, this time when constraint 3 applies, stipulating that the Cb must be the highest-ranked element of Cf(c) realized in 4d, Ziroo must be the highest-ranked entity realized, and therefore must be the Cb. At this point it is clear that some kind of SHIFT is forced by the application of constraint 3. The two candidates are a SMOOTH-SHIFT and a ROUGH-SHIFT. The SMOOTH-SHIFT interpretation corresponds to the reading Ziroo invited Taroo to a movie whereas the ROUGH-SHIFT interpretation corresponds to the Taroo invited Ziroo reading. The SMOOTH-SHIFT interpretation is more highly ranked, thus considered more coherent and so is the preferred interpretation (Z = 10.93, p < .001). The Centering Algorithm The CENTERING ALGORITHM that was proposed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard incorporates the centering rules and constraints in addition to contra-indexing constraints on coreference (Reinhart 1976; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Iida 1993 ). These contra-indexing constraints specify that in a sentence such as He likes him, that he and him cannot co-specify the same discourse entity. The algorithm applies centering theory to the problem of resolving anaphoric reference. Application of the algorithm requires three basic steps.  In order to apply this algorithm to Japanese, possible Cb-Cf combinations (GEN-ERATE step 1) must be constructed from the surface string and information from the subcategorization frame of the verb. First the verb subcategorization is examined, and if there are more entities than appear in the surface string, zeros are postulated as forward centers. These zeros are then treated just like pronouns in English by the rest of the algorithm. We use a different ranking for the Cf for Japanese than for English, but this has no effect on the actual algorithm itself since the Cf ranking is a declarative parameter. The steps of the algorithm given above can be interleaved to improve computational efficiency. A simple implementation is to: \u2022 Never propose a Cf that violates linguistic constraints on contra-indexing. (In other words, apply the contra-indexing filter as early as possible to avoid Cb-Cf combinations that will be eliminated by that filter,) \u2022 If there are pronouns in an utterance, only propose pronouns as possible Cbs. (Collect the pronouns from the proposed Cfs as Cbs, from Rule 1.) In addition, it is simple to add additional filters to step (2) of the algorithm. For instance, any constraint that is lexically specified such as [\u00b1animacy] can be easily applied as a filter. It is also possible to pursue a 'best first' strategy by interleaving steps (1), (2), and (3) so that a CONTINUE will be found without extra processing if one exists. In example 5, we illustrate in more detail how the steps of the algorithm work and the difference between CONTINUE and RETAIN. Each utterance shows what the Cb and Cf would be for that utterance. We will mostly be concerned with the process of resolving the two zeros in utterance 5c. Example 5c has explained as the main verb, which requires an animate subject and object2. Since there are two animate zeros in 5c, which are also contra-indexed by syntactic constraints, both Ziroo and Taroo must be realized in 5c. Constraint (3) restricts the Cb to Taroo as the highest-ranked element from the Cf(Sb). The interpretive process must also generate the possible candidates for the Cf. If no constraints applied, then all four candidates shown above as Cfl, Cf2, Cf3, and Cf4 would be possible. However, the contraindexing filter will rule out Cf3 and Cf4. As mentioned above, there is no reason that these filters cannot be applied at the GENERATE phase rather than later on. The only CONTINUE interpretation available, Taroo explained the newly equipped functions to John, corresponds to the forward centers Cfl. It is a CONTINUE interpretation because Cb(5c) = Cb(5b) and also Cb(5c) = Cp(5c). The RETAIN interpretation is less preferred and is defined by the fact that Cb(5c) = Cb(5b), but Cb(5c) ~ Cp(5c). This example supports the claim that a CONTINUE is preferred over a RETAIN(Z ~-13.24, p < .001). In order to find this preferred continue interpretation in a 'best first' fashion, Taroo as the Cp(Ui-1) would be tried first as the Cb(Ui), and as the interpretation for the subject. Contraindexing rules out Taroo as the object, so John would be tried next as the object. In the next section, we examine further the application of centering to the interpretation of zeros in Japanese. We will examine the ranking of forward centers that we have adopted for Japanese and explain how this is partially determined by the way the Japanese language allows a speaker to express discourse functions. We will also give some examples of the interpretation of zeros in cases involving Japanese discourse markers for TOPIC and EMPATHY. Centering in Japanese The theory of centering is a formal specification that is intended to model attentional state and is defined by the rules and constraints given in Section 2.1. Attentional state in turn constrains the discourse participant's interpretation process; one aspect of attentional state is the notion of discourse salience. In the centering model, the ordering of the forward centers is an approximation of discourse salience. This in turn is the main determinant of discourse interpretation processes such as the resolution of zeros in Japanese. A crucial question then is what discourse factors must be considered to determine the ordering of the forward centers, Cf, in Japanese discourse. Being a subject has been shown to be an important factor for English; this is reflected in a Cf ordering by grammatical function (Prince 1981b; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988; Brennan submitted) . Aspects of surface order may also affect the interpretation (Di Eugenio 1990; Hajicova and Vrbova 1982 ). An interpretation algorithm can also use pronominalization as an indicator of what the speaker believes is salient (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished) . Furthermore, zeros in Japanese are not realized syntactically so that there must be a way to distinguish zeros from other entities inferred to be part of a discourse situation. Consider: Example 6 Taroo ga 0 aimasita. Taroo SUBJ OBJ2 met Taroo met (0). This sentence is not felicitous unless the addressee has already been given some information about the person that Taroo met, either in the current discourse or in previous discourses. In contrast, nonsubcategorized-for arguments such as adjuncts are not necessarily given a specific interpretation, but rather are given a nonspecific one. Example 7 Taroo ga Hanako ni aimasita. Taroo SUBJ Hanako OBJ2 met Taroo met Hanako. The sentence means that Taroo met Hanako at some time in some place: the temporal location of the meeting situation need not be specified. The speaker can utter this sentence even if the addressee does not know where and when Taroo met Hanako. Thus, in this work, we only represent obligatorily subcategorized arguments of the verb on the Cf, assuming that the salience of discourse entities is partially determined by virtue of filling a verb's argument role, and the information from the subcategorization frame is used to determine that a zero is present in an utterance. Zeros are then interpreted with reference to the current context. Prince has proposed that the current context should be categorized by ASSUMED FAMILIARITY (Prince 1981b; Horn 1986) , with a concomitant goal of determining the correlation between the use of certain linguistic forms and the types of assumed familiarity. The first division of assumed familiarity is into the subtypes of NEW, INFERABLE, and EVOKED. NEW can be divided into BRAND-NEW, discourse entities that are both new to the discourse and new to the hearer, and UNUSED, discourse entities old to the hearer but new to the discourse. The information status of EVOKED can be further divided into TEXTUALLY EVOKED, old in the discourse and therefore old to the hearer as well, and SITUATIONALLY EVOKED, entities in the current situation. INFERABLES are technically both hearer-new and discourse-new but depend on information that is old to the hearer and the discourse, and are often treated by speakers as though they were both hearer-old and discourse-old. There is a hierarchy of assumed familiarity in terms of discourse salience: Assumed Familiarity Hierarchy (Prince 1981b) : TEXTUALLY EVOKED > SITUATIONALLY EVOKED > INFERABLE > UNUSED > BRAND-NEW Zeros typically refer to EVOKED entities, 13 but there is a scale of relative salience among the EVOKED entities. In our theory this is modeled with Cf ranking. We repeat the proposed ranking of the Cf here and justify it in the following sections: 14 Cf Ranking for Japanese (GRAMMATICAL OR ZERO) TOPIC > EMPATHY > SUBJECT > OBJECT2 > OBJECT > OTHERS The relevance of the notions of TOPIC and speaker's EMPATHY to centering is that a discourse entity realized as the TOPIC or the EMPATHY LOCUS is more salient and should be ranked higher on the Cf. Whenever a discourse entity simultaneously fulfills multiple roles, the entity is usually ranked according to the highest ranked role. In the following sections we will discuss the motivation for this ranking. Section 3.1 discusses the role of the grammatical topic marker wa in Japanese. Section 3.2 explains the role of EMPATHY in Japanese discourse salience and shows that (GRAMMATICAL OR ZERO) TOPIC > EMPATHY and that EMPATHY > SUBJ. Section 3.2.1 shows how the centering algorithm handles utterances with empathy loci. Zero topics will not be discussed until Section 5. Topic Discourse entities that are EVOKED, INFERABLE, or UNUSED can be marked as the TOPIC. The speaker cannot mark an entity as the grammatical TOPIC unless the hearer is aware of the object that s/he is going to talk about (Prince 1978a; Kuno 1976b) . For example: Example 8 Hutari wa paatii ni kimasita. two-person TOP/SUBJ party to came Speaking of two persons, they came to the party. 13 Under certain circumstances that we cannot explore here, it appears that zeros can at times be used to refer to inferable or unused entities, just as pronouns in English sometimes can be. 14 This ranking resembles Kuno's Empathy Hierarchy and Kameyama's Expected Center Order, but we distinguish two kinds of TOPIC and we posit that OBJECT2 is more salient than OBJECT. We continue Kuno's use of the term EMPATHY to represent the EMPATHY LOCUS, whereas Kameyama used the property IDENT for EMPATHY (Kameyama 1988) . Example 8 is felicitous only when hutari ('two persons') is understood as meaning the two people under discussion. The sentence never means that the people who came to the party numbered two. The fact that the wa-marked entity should be discourse-old is also shown by the fact that a wh-question cannot be answered with a wa-marked NP. Example 11 Taroo wa Hanako ga bengosita. Taroo TOP Hanako SUBJ defended As for Taroo, Hanako defended (him). Example 12 Tokyoo e wa Hanako ga itta\u00b0 Tokyo to TOP Hanako SUBJ went To Tokyo, Hanako went. The assumption that the TOPIC is more salient than the SUBJECT, when the two are different, is supported by the fact that an indefinite NP in subject position such as who, which, or somebody cannot be regarded as the TOPIC: an indefinite NP is never marked by the topic marker wa, but by the subject marker ga. It is clear from these examples that the grammatical topic, wa-marked entity, in Japanese, represents assumable shared information in an ongoing conversation. It has been taken to be the 'theme' or 'what the sentence is about' (Kuno 1973; Shibatani 1990 ). In our framework, this is the role of the Cb. We will provide evidence supporting this position in Section 4. However, we claim that this is just a default and that other factors can contribute to establishing or continuing an entity as the Cb. Kuno also claims that a zero subject is equivalent to a wa-marked entity, and we provide support for this claim in Section 5, showing that the property of having previously been the Cb, in combination with being realized by a zero, contributes to an entity being the Cp. Kuno (1976b) proposed a notion of EMPATHY in order to present the speaker's position or identification in describing a situation. In a hugging situation involving a man named Taroo and his son Saburoo, Kuno notes that this situation can be described in various ways, some of which are shown in example 15. Empathy Example 15 a. Taroo hugged Saburoo. b. Taroo hugged his son. c. Saburoo's father hugged him. These sentences differ from each other with respect to camera angle, the position that the speaker takes to observe and describe this situation. In 15a, the speaker is assumed to be describing the event objectively: the camera is placed at the same distance from both Taroo and Saburoo. On the other hand, the camera may be placed closer to Taroo in 15b and closer to Saburoo in 15c. This is shown by the use of relational terms such as son and father, respectively. The term EMPATHY is used for this camera angle, which indicates the speaker's position among the participants in the event describedY 15 The speaker's position is not determined by his physical proximity, but rather is measured by the emotional or social relationship. In this sense, the term speaker's identification (Kuno 1976b ) may be more suitable than the term speaker's position. Furthermore, the notion of EMPATHY is different from that of perspective (Iida 1993) . Empathy is the speaker's identification with a discourse entity, but the speaker does not have to take the perspective of the person who he empathizes with. For example, consider the following utterance: (i) Taroo wa Hanako ni migigawa no hon o totte-kureta. Taroo TOP/SUBJ Hanako OBJ2 right GEN book OBJ take-gave Taroo did Hanako a flavor in taking a book on his~her right. In this example, the speaker empathizes with Hanako as indicated by the empathy verb kureru, yet he still can describe the given situation from Taroo's perspective, which is indicated by ambiguity in the interpretation of the deictic expression migigawa no ('right of'). In Japanese the realization of speaker's empathy is especially important when describing an event involving giving or receiving. There is no way to describe a giving and receiving situation objectively (Kuno and Kaburaki 1977) . In 16, the use of the verb kureru indicates the speaker's empathy with Ziroo, the discourse entity realized in object position, while in 17, the speaker's empathy with the subject Taroo is indicated by the use of the past tense form yatta of the verb yaru. Example 16 Taroo ga Ziroo ni hon o kureta. Taroo SUBJ Ziroo OBJ2 book OBJ gave Taroo gave Ziroo a book. EMPATHY=OBJ2=ZIROO Example 17 Taroo ga Ziroo ni hon o yatta. Taroo SUBJ Ziroo OBJ2 book OBJ gave Taroo gave Ziroo a book. EMPATHY=SUB=TAROO A verb that is sensitive to the speaker's empathy is an EMPATHY-LOADED verb. The EMPATHY LOCUS is the argument position whose referent the speaker automatically identifies with. In other words, the verb kureru has the EMPATHY LOCUS on the object, while verbs like yaru place the EMPATHY LOCUS on the subject. The use of deictic verbs such as kuru ('come'), iku ('go'), okuru ('send to'), and yokosu ('send in') also encode the speaker's empathy. For example, the speaker indicates empathy with Taroo by using the past tense form kita of the verb kuru in the following example. Example 18 Hanako wa Taroo no tokoro ni kita. Hanako TOP/SUBJ Taroo of place to came Hanako came to Taroo's place. Many Japanese verbs can be made into empathy-loaded verbs because of a productive verb-compounding operation by which these empathy-loaded verbs are used as the auxiliary verb, attaching to the main verb} 6 For example, kureru can be used as a suffix, to mark OBJ or OBJ2 as the EMPATHY LOCUS. The attachment of yaru marks SUBJECT as the EMPATHY LOCUS. The complex predicate made by this operation inherits the EMPATHY LOCUS of the suffixed verb. For example: Example 19 Hanako ga Taroo ni hon o yonde-kureta. Hanako SUBJ Taroo OBJ2 book OBJ read-gave Hanako did Taroo a favor in reading a book. EMPATHY = OBJ2 = TAROO In this case Taroo is interpreted as the EMPATHY LOCUS because of the auxiliary kureta attached to the main verb. Similarly in example 20, the speaker indicates empathy with Hanako by using the past tense form yatta of the verb yaru as an auxiliary verb to the main verb tazuneru. 16 Certain intransitive verbs cannot be made into empathy-loaded verbs since the empathy-loaded versions make no sense, e.g. moreru (leak). Example 20 Hanako ga Taroo o tazunete-yatta. Hanako SUBI Taroo OBJ visit-gave (lit.)Hanako received a favor in visiting Taroo. EMPATHY = SUBJ = HANAKO As demonstrated in the following examples, a discourse entity that is realized as the EMPATHY LOCUS must be EVOKED. Example 21 Taroo ga Ziroo ni okane o kasite-kureta. Taroo SUBJ Ziroo OBJ2 money OBJ lend-gave Taroo did Ziroo a favor in lending him some money. Example 22 *Taroo ga dareka ni okane o kasite-kureta. Taroo SUBJ somebody OBJ2 money OBJ lend-gave Taroo did somebody a favor in lending him some money. Example 23 *Taroo ga misiranu hito ni okane o kasite-kureta. Taroo SUBJ unknown person OBJ2 money OBJ lend-gave Taroo did a stranger a favor in lending him some money. The contrast between 21, 22, and 23 demonstrates that the use of a BRAND-NEW entity in the EMPATHY LOCUS position of the verb give is not acceptable. Therefore an entity in the EMPATHY LOCUS position is ranked in a higher position on the Cf than the subject. Empathy and the Centering Algorithm. Using the Centering Algorithm, we model EMPATHY as a language-specific discourse factor by adding the EMPATHY-marked discourse entity to the Cf ranking. Then preferences for CONTINUE over RETAIN when EMPATHY is involved can be demonstrated, as in example 24 below: 17 SUBJ OBJ In 24c, the verb invited requires an animate subject and object, and these must be realized by different discourse entities because of the contraindexing constraint. Hanako is the most highly ranked entity from 24b that is realized in 24c, and therefore must be the Cb. The preferred interpretation is therefore she invited him to a movie (Z = 5.25, p < .001). This corresponds to Cfl, the more highly ranked CONTINUE transition, in which Hanako is the preferred center, Cp. This interpretation can be found with minimal processing by trying the Cp(24b), Hanako, as the Cb(24c), by interpreting the subject zero as Hanako. This gives a CONTINUE transition. Then contraindexing constraints mean that Hanako cannot fill both argument positions, so the object position is interpreted as Taroo. This interpretation is found with minimal processing by interleaving the steps of the Centering algorithm proposed in Brennan et al. (1987) . Note that nothing special needs to be said about the fact that EMPATHY is the discourse factor that made Hanako the Cp in 24b and thus predicted that Hanako would be the Cb at 24c (pace Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987) . The preference in the interpretation follows from the distinction between CONTINUE and RETAIN and the ranking of Cf. Thus, the centering framework is easily adapted to handle this language-specific feature. Topic and Empathy In general the assignment of the EMPATHY relationship is pragmatic. It is determined by the speaker's relation to the discourse participants in the discourse. In 24, for example, the EMPATHY relationship between the speaker and Hanako and between the speaker and Taroo is clear: the use of the empathy verb in the second sentence indicates that the speaker is closer to Hanako than to Taroo. However, besides cases where the speaker clearly expresses who s/he empathizes with, it is also possible for the context to provide some information about the speaker's proximity relationship with discourse participants in the given discourse, so that the hearer can determine the EMPATHY relation that the speaker has in mind. In this paper, we only consider cases where EMPATHY is syntactically marked by the use of empathyloaded verbs. Kuno's notion of EMPATHY is more general. For instance, Kuno's EMPATHY HIERAR-CHY consists of different scales for EMPATHY that include notions such as TOPIC and SPEAKER (Kuno 1987 ). Kuno's Topic Empathy Hierarchy suggests that the discourse entity realized as the TOPIC will often coincide with the EMPATHY LOCUS: Topic Empathy Hierarchy: Discourse-Topic > Discourse-Nontopic Given an event or state that involves A and B such that A is coreferential with the topic of the present discourse and B is not, it is easier for the speaker to empathize with A than with B. In support of Kuno's claim, we have found that when no empathy relation is clearly indicated and no topic has been clearly established that it is difficult for a hearer to determine the empathy relation that the speaker intends. Previous Cbs and current Cps can be high on the empathy scale, and yet the discourse entity realized as the grammatical TOPIC does not necessarily coincide with the discourse entity realized as the EMPATHY LOCUS. A simple sentence to show this point is given in example 25 below: Example 25 Taroo wa Ziroo ni hon o yonde-kuremasita. Taroo TOP/SUBJ Ziroo OBJ2 book OBJ read-gave Taroo gave Ziroo a //avor off reading a book. EMPATHY = OBJ2 = ZIROO In example 25, Taroo is the TOPIC while Ziroo is the EMPATHY LOCUS. Similarly, a zero does not have to be realized as the EMPATHY LOCUS. In 26b the zero in the subject position realizes the Cb and refers to Taroo. The TOPIC Mitiko is preferred as the unexpressed subject of the (b) sentence in example 27. TM On the other hand, the subject Mitiko is not strongly preferred, as shown in example 28: the zero in the second sentence in 28 is understood as referring to either Mitiko or my wife. That is, the possible interpretation in these examples shows that the NP my wife, which is realized as the EMPATHY LOCUS, is not as salient as the TOPIC. 19 So why is it easier to empathize with a discourse entity that has been the topic as Kuno demonstrates? It seems important to keep the notions of TOPIC and EMPATHY separate, but in Section 5.1 we will demonstrate an effect where the topic entity is interpreted as the empathy locus. We claim that the ranking of the Cf and the potential for a CONTINUE interpretation determines whether this effect will hold. In other words, the tendency for the topic entity to be interpreted as the empathy locus follows from more general discourse processing factors, such as a hearer preferring CONTINUE transitions within a given local stretch of discourse. Summary To summarize, we have outlined the roles of discourse markers such as those for TOPIC and EMPATHY by which Japanese grammaticizes some aspects of discourse function, and we have argued that TOPIC and EMPATHY markers can only be used on entities that are already in the discourse context. One factor that hasn't been discussed is the role of pronominalization, but many researchers have argued that discourse entities realized by pronouns are more salient than other discourse entities (Clark and Haviland 1977; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished; Kuno 1976b Kuno , 1987)) . We take zeros in Japanese to be analogous to pronouns in English in this respect. Since pronominalization can apply at any position in the ranking of the Cf, the role of its contribution is particularly interesting when it is in conflict with some other factor such as grammatical function or topic marking. This will be discussed further in Section 5. Initial Center Instantiation INITIAL CENTER INSTANTIATION is a process by which a discourse entity introduced in a segment-initial utterance becomes the Cb. In our framework, this happens as a side effect of the Centering Algorithm. Typically, when an interpretation is found for the second utterance in a discourse segment, the Cb becomes instantiated. 2\u00b0 The Cb of an initial utterance Ui is treated as a variable that is then unified with whatever Cb is assigned to the subsequent utterance Ui+l. Typically, a discourse entity is introduced as a ga-marked subject, and then is referred to by a zero in a subsequent utterance (Clancy and Downing 1987) . Consider example 29. 18 The zero may be interpreted as indirectly referring to the speaker. This interpretation is always possible when the verb kureru is used: the use of kureru implies that the speaker is closer to the beneficiary argument (i.e. the 0-marked NP in these examples), and the favor given to this person is understood as a benefit to the speaker as well. 19 Although it seems as though empathy isn't higher than subject, the conflating factor is that topic marking establishes a Cb, whereas in 28 no Cb has been established. This is explained in detail in Section 4. 20 In Walker, Iida, and Cote (1990) we called this Center Establishment. Henceforth we will refer to this process as Center Instantiation in order to avoid confusion with Kameyama's term center establishment, which is a different mechanism in her theory (Kameyama 1985) . Example 29 a. Taroo ga b. deeta o konpyuutaa ni utikondeimasita. Taroo SUBJ data OBJ computer in was-storing Taroo was storing the data in a computer. Cb: [?] I Cf: [TAROO, DATA] 0 yatto hanbun yari-owarimasita. SUBJ finally half do-finished Finally (Taroo) was half finished. [ Cb: TAROO ] Cf: [TAROO] CONTINUE Using Taroo as the subject in example 29a is not enough to establish this discourse segment as being about Taroo. It is the use of the zero in example 29b that serves to instantiate Taroo as the Cb. By our definition of CONTINUE, 29b is a continue transition, because Cb(29b) = Cp(29b) and there was no Cb in 29a. However, Kuno argues that referring to a discourse entity with a zero is equivalent to marking it as the grammatical topic with wa (Kuno 1972) . Our interpretation of this argument is that the use of wa in a discourse-initial utterance instantiates the wa-marked entity as the Cb in one utterance. This claim is supported by the contrast with the GA-WA alternation in examples 30 and 31, where there is a shift in interpretation depending on whether Taroo is marked with wa in the first sentence. 21 Example 30 a. Taroo ga b. Ziroo o min'na no mae de tatakimasita. SUBJ OBJ all of front in hit. Taroo hit Ziroo in front of all the other people. Cb: [71 [ Cf: [TAROO, ZIROO] Itiniti-zyuu, kanzen-ni 0 0 musi-simasita. all-day completely ignored (Ziroo) ignored (Taroo) all day. Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO, ZIROO] 3 Cb: ZIROO Cf: [ZIROO, TAROO] 8 In example 30, Taroo is introduced by ga. In this case, it appears that there is a tendency due to lexical semantics to instantiate Ziroo as the Cb in the second utterance. 22 By the centering definitions, taking either Taroo or Ziroo to be the Cb can result in a CONTINUE interpretation. However, assuming that the Cf ordering at example 30a is correct, constraint 3 is violated by the preferred interpretation of 30b. Since both of the entities in Cf(30a) are realized, the Cb in example 30b should be the most highly ranked one. There are two possible conclusions here: (1) In discourse-initial utterances, when 21 These examples were tested by asking survey participants to indicate preference rankings. The numbers given here are only for those subjects who expressed strong preferences; some subjects expressed no preference. 22 The number of subjects here are too small to test statistically. no clear indication of topic is given, the Cf ordering alone is not a strong constraint; (2) the ordering of the Cf should be partly determined by lexical semantics or other knowledge about the situation being described. However, compare example 30 with example 31. Example 31 a. Taroo wa Ziroo o min'na no mae de tatakimasita. SUBJ OBJ all of front in hit. Taroo hit Ziroo in front of all the other people. Cb: [TARO0] Cf: [TAROO, ZIRO0] b. Itiniti-zyuu, kanzen-ni 0 0 musi-simasita. all-day completely ignored The use of wa in example 31 seems to override the semantic preference that was exhibited in example 30, so that subjects now prefer an interpretation in which Taroo is the Cb. 23 This shows that Taroo has not been instantiated as the Cb when it is time to interpret the two zeros in example 30b. We explain the contrast by assuming that the TOPIC instantiates the Cb when it is first introduced in a discourse-initial utterance, as in example 31a. Then the only way to get a CONTINUE interpretation for 31b is for Taroo to be the Cb at 31b. Furthermore, we can detect no differences in the interpretation of the final utterance between three utterance sequences in which an entity is introduced by wa, and four utterance sequences in which an entity is first introduced by ga and then realized by a zero in the second utterance. This provides further support for the claim that the status of discourse entities realized as grammatical topics and those realized as zero subjects is equivalent. Summary In sum, we have argued that the use of wa in a discourse-initial utterance instantiates the wa-marked entity as the Cb. Cb instantiation can equivalently be done with a twoutterance sequence in which the entity is first introduced as a subject, ga-marked, and then established as the Cb in the following utterance with a zero referring to that entity. In addition, the fact that the Cb is uninstantiated in discourse initial utterances has the effect that the Cf ranking in a discourse initial utterance is not a strong constraint, as it is once a Cb is established. Zero Topic Assignment In this section we introduce the notion of a ZERO TOPIC and a rule or assumption that can be employed as part of the interpretive process called ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT. 23 The small number of subjects means that we can't provide statistical support for this claim. The rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT defines our distinction between grammatical topic and zero topic. This rule allows a zero that has just been the Cb to continue as the Cp, even when it is not realized in a discourse-salient syntactic position such as subject. We will demonstrate this with examples that realize both grammatical and zero topics. In these cases, the discourse situation is such that the hearer may maintain multiple hypotheses about where the speaker's attention is directed, and must determine whether to apply the default that the grammatical topic is usually the Cp. 24 Zero Topic Assignment When a zero in Ui+l represents an entity that was the Cb(Ui), and when no other CONTINUE transition is available, that zero may be interpreted as the ZERO TOPIC of Ui+l. What this means is that, in certain discourse environments, the entity that was previously the Cb is predicted to continue as the Cb. We conjecture that ZTA is applicable in all free word-order languages with zeros. 25 However, ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT is optional; here we have suggested two constraints on when it applies. We will give examples below of cases where it doesn't apply. The option of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT (henceforth ZTA) has been overlooked in previous treatments of zeros in Japanese. ZTA explains why the discourse entity Hanako, which is realized as OBJECT2 in example 32c is interpreted as the SUBJECT of example 32d. [MITIKO, HANAKO, SOLUTION] RETAIN SUBJ, OBJ2, OBJ 24 While some of the utterance sequences we examine are potentially ambiguous for native speakers, the examination of these discourse situations offers considerable insight into those where there is no ambiguity. 25 We only look at object topics here but there may be limits as to how lowly ranked on the Cf an entity can be and still be the zero topic, e.g. by-passive agentive. [MITIKO, LUNCH, HANAKO] SMOOTH-SHIFT from Cf2(c) 6 SUBJ, OBJ2, OBJ The possibility of ambiguity as to the attentional state of the speaker is reflected in the fact that there are two possible Cfs for example 32c; Cf2 of 32c is the only Cf possible without ZTA, and represents a RETAIN rather than a CONTINUE. By the formulation of the ZTA rule above, ZTA is triggered by the fact that no CONTINUE transition is available. The availability of ZTA means that HANAKO can be the Cp even when MITIKO is realized as the subject. This leads to a potential ambiguity in example 32d, because it is possible for a hearer to simultaneously entertain both of the Cf(32c). In this case the ZTA interpretation is preferred (Z = 4.95, p < .001). The less preferred SMOOTH-SHIFT interpretation would result from the algorithm's application to Cf2 of 32c. 26 ZTA explains the contrast between the discourse segments,in examples 32 above and 33 below. The only difference between 32 and 33 is that in 32c, MITIKO is a gamarked subject, whereas in 33c, MITIKO is a wa-marked subject/grammatical topic. Utterances 32c and 33c have the same meaning. This minimal pair provides a test to see whether ZTA actually characterizes these discourse related effects.  The wa marking has the predicted effect. Using the grammatical topic marker wa in example 33c dampens ZTA and thus affects the interpretation of example 33d, which is now completely ambiguous (Z = 0.34, not significantly different than chance). Because the discourse entity realized as the grammatical topic and indicated by the wa-marked NP is the Cp by default, ten subjects who previously did so can no longer get an interpretation that depends on ZTA. It seems that the situation can be characterized as a case of competing defaults, so that in example 33, some hearers apply the default that the wa-marked entity is the Cp, and others apply the default that CONTINUE interpretations are preferred and that zeros realize discourse entities that are ranked highly on the Cf. The RETA1N interpretation in example 33c, Cf2, indicates that these hearers expect the conversation to shift to being about Mitiko; the fact that Mitiko is the Cp(33c), along with constraint 3 will force a shift. Given a SHIFT, the Mitiko invited Hanako to lunch interpretation is preferred because it is the more highly ranked SMOOTH-SHIFT transition. 27 These examples clearly show that the wa-rnarked NP is not always the Cp and support Shibatani's claim that the interpretation of wa depends on the discourse context (Shibatani 1990 ). The astute reader will have noticed that in the cases where Hanako is a zero topic, the wa-marked Mitiko discourse entity is ranked according to grammatical function. We conjecture that an inference of contrast is supported when the grammatical topic is not the Cp. The following section discusses the interaction of ZTA with empathy. Then in Section 5.2, we discuss further the ramifications of our distinction between grammatical and zero topic. Empathy and Zero Topic Assignment This section investigates the interaction of EMPATHY and ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT (ZTA). The discourse segment in example 34 is a minimal pair with that in example 35. In 34d the main verb is setumeisita ('explain') without any EMPATHY marking, whereas in 35d, the same sentence occurs with an auxiliary empathy verb as setumeisitekureta. Remember that kureta marks the OBJ or OBJ2 as the EMPATHY LOCUS. The interpretations of example 34d show that it is possible for some subjects to interpret Taroo as the zero topic in example 34c. This is possible because Taroo was both the Cp and the Cb for 34a and 34b. The two Cfs of 34c reflect multiple possibilities in attentional state. 28 The competing defaults consist of the assumption that ZTA applies, versus the assumption that subjects are more highly ranked than objects on the Cf. In this case no preference between the two interpretations can be demonstrated (Z = 1.79, not significant). Example 35 is a minimal pair with example 34. In 35d, the speaker provides more syntactic information by using the empathy verb kureta to indicate that the discourse entity realized as the OBJECT2 is the EMPATHY lOCUS. Example 35 a. Taroo wa deeta o konpyuutaa ni utikondeimasita. Taroo TOP/SUBJ data OBJ computer in was-storing Taroo was storing the data in a computer. Ziroo ga 0 hurui deeta o misemasita. Ziroo SUBJ OBJ2 old data OBJ showed Ziroo showed (Taroo) some old data. the interpretation changes so that the utterance is no longer ambiguous (Z = 16.24, p < .001). In this case it is possible to interpret both example 35c and example 35d as CONTINUES by assuming ZTA at 35c. This example also validates ZTA because empathy associates with the zero topic (Kuno 1976b (Kuno , 1987)) . Furthermore, this minimal pair highlights aspects of the interaction between syntax and inference. Note that the interpretation of the last utterance in example 36d remains the same as that in example 35d, although in this case it is Taroo that shows Ziroo some old data in example 36c; nevertheless Ziroo is the one who does the explaining. It seems that inference from world knowledge and domain information alone is unlikely to predict which interpretations hearers will prefer. Inferential processes and discourse structure are mutually constraining (Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Nadathur and Joshi 1983; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988) . Summary We proposed a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT and showed that ZTA is conditioned by the rules and constraints of centering theory: (1) ZTA only applies to discourse entities that were previously the Cb; (2) ZTA is constrained to cases where the only transition available otherwise would be a RETAIN. ZTA arises from the interaction between preferences for CONTINUE transitions (Rule 2) and the fact that Cbs are often zeros (Rule 1). The interaction of these two factors leads to the speculation that when the Cb is realized by a pronoun in a lower ranked Cf position, which gives rise to a RETAIN transition state, that this type of transition is inherently ambiguous. Since different factors contribute to the salience of discourse entities, such as 'subjecthood' and 'pronominalization' (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished) , conflicting defaults can arise when these are in conflict with one another. This may be especially true in Japanese since another factor that should contribute to Cf ranking, word order, is not present whenever zeros are involved. These examples highlight the relation between centering and global coherence in discourse. A RETAIN is proposed as a way for a speaker to mark a coordinated transition to a new topic; it predicts a shift (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987) . However, the way in which centering SHIFT transitions are related to larger structures in discourse has not been specified. If a shift functions as a boundary between segments (Walker 1993b), then the hearer's application of ZTA means that the hearer is assuming that the next utterance will be part of the same discourse segment. In contrast, a hearer's assumption that the current centering transition is a RETAIN means that the hearer assumes that the next utterance will begin a new discourse segment. The relationship between segmentation and hearer's preferences for ZTA or RE-TAIN interpretations may be affected by other discourse factors. Among these factors, intonation may indicate whether the current utterance should be taken as initiating a new segment and predicting a SHIFT, or continuing the previous one (Silverman 1987; Cahn, 1992; Swerts and Geluykens 1992; Walker and Prince 1994) . Another factor may be the inferred relationship that holds between adjacent utterances such as whether it is possible to interpret (d) as Ziroo's reason for having done (c) (Hobbs 1985b ). However this is clearly not the only factor, or even necessarily the dominant one, as we have demonstrated. Future research must provide additional constraints on when ZTA is applicable. Related Research Other researchers working on the interpretation of anaphors have focused on the role of inference from world knowledge (Hobbs 1985b (Hobbs , 1979)) . While it is important to elucidate the information needed for inference and the type of inferential process involved in discourse interpretation, it is clear from our examples that syntactic realization has a strong effect on the interpretive process and provides processing constraints on inferential processes. We have focused on the interaction between syntax and inference. Our treatment of Japanese discourse phenomena builds on earlier work by Kuno (Kuno 1972 (Kuno , 1973 (Kuno , 1987 (Kuno , 1989)) . Our Cf ranking is consistent with Kuno's Empathy and Topic Hierarchies and we incorporate a number of Kuno's observations on the function of the grammatical topic marker wa and the role of zeros. We have also incorporated Kuno's notion of EMPATHY by using EMPATHY in the Cf ranking (Kuno 1976a; Kuno and Kaburaki 1977) . In recent work, Kuno proposes an algorithmic account of the interpretation of zeros. He claims that there are two types of zero pronouns, PSEUDO-ZERO-PRONOUNS and REAL-ZERO-PRONOUNS (Kuno 1989 ). REAL-ZERO-PRONOUNS are supposed to have a wa-marked NP or a presentational NP as an antecedent (Yoshimoto 1988). PSEUDO-ZERO-PRONOUNS are actually examples of deletion, and must follow the same order and the same syntactic function as their source NPs. They must obey constraints on deletion such as Kuno's Pecking Order of Deletion Principle: Delete less important information first and more important information last. According to Kuno, the position just to the left of the verb is the default focus position in Japanese, unless the verb itself is the focus. Therefore, since the verb in example 37b is the information focus, the zeros are assumed to be PSEUDO-ZERO-PRONOUNS. C. Hanako ga sukida. Taroo TOP/SUBJ Hanako fond-of-is Taroo likes Hanako. Ziroo wa Natuko ga sukida. Ziroo TOP/SUBJ Natuko fond-of-is Ziroo likes Natuko. 0 Saburoo mo sukida. Saburoo also fond-of-is (Ziroo) also likes Saburoo. *Saburoo also likes (Natuko). Kuno's account treats Ziroo in example 38c as a REAL-ZERO-PRONOUN. In this case we would predict the preferred interpretation based on our distinction between CON-TINUE and RETAIN. However, consider the following example: Example 39 a. Taroo wa b. Hanako ga sukida. Taroo TOP/SUBJ Hanako fond-of-is Taroo likes Hanako. Ziroo wa kirai da. Ziroo TOP/SUBJ 0 fond-of-is (Taroo) dislikes Ziroo. Ziroo dislikes (Hanako). *Ziroo dislikes (Taroo). The Taroo dislikes Ziroo interpretation would be an example of ZTA. However, we would predict that the Ziroo dislikes Hanako interpretation would be dispreferred, but this does not seem to be the case. Kuno's analysis treats the zero in the second reading of example 39b as a PSEUDO-ZERO-PRONOUN, which means that it must be interpreted as Hanako since Hanako was the object of the previous utterance. The interpretation of 39b that we would predict as possible would be the Ziroo dislikes Taroo (RETAIN), which native speakers rarely get. However, Kuno's analysis does not block this reading either; the zero in 39b could also be a REAL-ZERO-PRONOUN, with Taroo as its antecedent. Kuno says that this interpretation is dispreferred because of a preference for parallel interpretation (Grober, Beardsley, and Caramazza 1978; Sidner 1979; Kameyama 1988; Kuno 1989 ). We have claimed here and elsewhere (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990 ) that the preference for parallelism is an epiphenomenon of the ordering of the Cf and the preference for CONTINUE interpretations. Our account cannot explain the contrast between examples 38 and 39. It seems that what is at issue here is the fact that a set of discourse entities plus an open proposition such as X likes Y is what is discourse-old in these examples and not just a discourse entity (Prince 1981a (Prince , 1986 (Prince , 1992)) . Our conclusion is that these enumerated lists and question-answer discourse segments may need an account of discourse center that is broader than that needed for discourse entities realized as NPS. Ktmo's constraints on deletion must also be integrated to fully explain when entities or propositions in the discourse may be unexpressed. Our analysis also builds on an earlier analysis put forth by Kameyama (Kameyama 1985 (Kameyama , 1986 (Kameyama , 1988)) . Although Kameyama uses the centering terminology, her account is not based on the constraints and rules of centering theory as developed here and presented in (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, unpublished; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987) . Kameyama proposed that the interpretation of zeros in Japanese depends on a default preference hierarchy of syntactic properties to be shared between the antecedent and the zero (Grober, Beardsley, and Caramazza 1978 ). Kameyama's account of zero interpretation consists roughly of a PROPERTY-SHARING CONSTRAINT, henceforth PS, and an EXPECTED CENTER ORDER, henceforth ECO, which may be paraphrased as follows: PROPERTY-SHARING CONSTRAINT: Two zero-pronouns in adjacent utterances, which co-specify the same Cb-encoding discourse entity, should share one of the following properties (in descending order of preference): 1) both IDENT and SUBJECT, 2) IDENT alone, 3) SUBJECT-alone, 4) both NONIDENT and NONSUBJECT, 5) NONSUBJECT alone, or 6) NONIDENT alone. EXPECTED CENTER ORDER RULE: In a sentence that contains a centerestablishing zero, if it is to have a full NP as its antecedent, the default preference order among its potential antecedent NPs is: Topic > Ident > Subject > Object(2) > Others. As noted earlier, we use a modified version of Kameyama's EXPECTED CENTER ORDER as the ordering of the Cf, but Kameyama's treatment differs from ours in a number of respects. First, Kameyama used the property IDENT to describe something similar to Kuno's notion of EMPATHY, and has an added assumption of a SUBJECT IDENT default, i.e. subjects are considered to be EMPATHY loci by default. This means that her theory also includes a neutralization device for cases where this default is not in effect (Kameyama 1988) . In contrast, our theory explains examples covered by the SUBJECT IDENT default by including EMPATHY in the ranking of the Cf list and by the distinction between CONTINUE and RETAIN, as illustrated in example 24. We have also expanded Kameyama's treatment of TOPIC. We have elucidated the interaction of topic with subject and empathy markers and supported our claim that the topic marker wa functions similarly to pronominalization in instantiating the Cb. In addition, ZTA and the distinction that we make between grammatical and zero topic is new to our account. Furthermore, since Center Instantiation is a side effect of the application of the centering algorithm, we treat 40c and 41c with the same mechanism. In Kameyama's analysis, the PS constraint applies to example 40, while the ECO applies in example 41.   Taroo wa 0 hon o yonde-kure-masita. Taroo TOP/SUBJ OBJ2 book OBI read-gave Taroo did her a flavor of reading a book. Note that we annotate example 40b with Kameyama's IDENT property, which corresponds to EMPATHY. Kameyama's account predicts that there are different processes going on in the resolution of zeros depending on the environments where the zero appears. PS applies in the case of example 40c because the previous utterance has a zero, but it doesn't apply in the case of example 41b. PS would seem to predict that the zero pronoun in 40c should not be interpreted as Hanako, since the zero carries the properties [SuBJ, IDENT] in 40b and [NONSUBJ, NONIDENT] in 40c. In other words, none of the required properties of SUBJ, IDENT, NONSUBJ, NONIDENT, which 'should' be shared according to the PS constraint, are shared. But in fact 40c is perfectly acceptable under the intended reading of Taroo severely criticized Hanako, and 41b is likewise acceptable under the reading Taroo did Hanako a favor of reading a book. Also, as pointed out in Kuno (1989) The PS Constraint applies only to two zeros in adjacent sentences, and the ECO applies only when a Cb is to be established. Example 42c is not a Cb-establishing utterance since the Cb ha s already been established in 42b, so the ECO should not apply. The PS constraint does apply and predicts that the subject zero must have the subject of 42b as its antecedent, but the theory makes no predictions about the possible interpretations for the zero object. Many of the examples that are explained in Kameyama's theory by the PS constraint are handled on our account by the distinction between CONTINUE and RETAIN. However, there are a number of cases where PS makes different predictions than our account. In particular, note that for examples 32 and 35, Kameyama's SUBJECT IDENT default makes exactly the opposite prediction. Example 35 is repeated below as example 43 and annotated with the SUBJECT IDENT default feature. According to PS, the interpretation in which the property IDENT is shared is preferred to the one with SUBJECT shared, and hence, the interpretation Taroo did Ziroo a favor in explaining several d~ferences is preferred. However our survey shows that native speakers prefer the Ziroo did Taroo a favor reading; this is explained by our discourse rule of ZTA and by including empathy in the ranking of the Cf list. Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we have attempted to elucidate the interaction of syntactic realization and discourse salience in Japanese using the discourse-processing framework of CEN-TERING. In our theory discourse salience is operationalized by the ranking of the forward centers for an utterance. We explored speakers' options for indicating salience in Japanese discourse, especially the interaction of discourse markers for TOPIC and EMPATHY. We then posited a ranking and used it to explain some facts about the interpretation of zeros in Japanese. While there is clearly a correlation between syntax and discourse function, we show that discourse context plays an important role. We proposed a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT (ZTA), which distinguishes grammatical and zero topic. We showed that centering allows us to formalize constraints on when ZTA can apply. However, future work must determine additional constraints on when ZTA applies, and which language families support ZTA. The preferred interpretation of zeros and the discourse factors that are responsible for each interpretation are summarized below. Remember that in each case the zero in the third utterance was established as the Cb by the previous two utterances: This analysis suggests that centering may be a universal of context-dependent processing of language, although so far this theory has only been applied to English, German, Turkish, Japanese, and Italian (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker 1989; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990; Di Eugenio 1990; Cote 1992; Rambow 1993; Nakatani 1993; Hofhnan 1995; Turan 1995) . We proposed that the centering component of a theory of discourse interpretation can be constructed in a language-independent fashion, up to the declaration of a language-specific value for one parameter of the theory, i.e., Cf ranking (as in Section 2). This parameter is language-dependent because different languages offer different means of expressing discourse function. We conjecture that ZTA may apply in any free-word order language with zeros. Future work must examine the interaction between centering and discourse segmentation in both monologue and dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990; Walker 1993b) , and the role of deictics, lexical semantics, one anaphora, and propositional discourse entities in centering (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Walker 1992 Walker , 1993a;; Cote 1995) . It is also important to examine the interaction of zeros with overt pronouns and with deictics and the interaction of pronominalization with accenting (Terken 1995). In addition, the semantic theory underlying centering must be further developed (Roberts 1995) . Finally, centering transitions are currently defined by an equality relation between discourse entities, but POSET relations and functional dependencies often link entities in discourse (Prince 1978b (Prince , 1981a;; Ward 1985; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished) . The predictions made here should also be tested on a large corpus of naturally occurring Japanese discourse (Hurewitz and Linson 1995) . like to thank the readers of comp.research.japanese and sci.lang.japan who participated in our survey.

    "abstract": "This paper has three aims: (1) to generalize a computational account of the discourse process called CENTERING, (2) to apply this account to discourse processing in Japanese so that it can be used in computational systems for machine translation or language understanding, and (3) to provide some insights on the effect of syntactic factors in Japanese on discourse interpretation. We argue that while discourse interpretation is an inferential process, syntactic cues constrain this process; we demonstrate this argument with respect to the interpretation of ZEROS, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in Japanese. The syntactic cues in Japanese discourse that we investigate are the morphological markers for grammatical TOPIC, the postposition wa, as well as those for grammatical functions such as SUBJECT, ga, OBJECT, o and OBJECT2, ni. In addition, we investigate the role of speaker's EMPATHY, which is the viewpoint from which an event is described. This is syntactically indicated through the use of verbal compounding, i.e. the auxiliary use of verbs such as kureta, kita. Our results are based on a survey of native speakers of their interpretation of short discourses, consisting of minimal pairs, varied by one of the above factors. We demonstrate that these syntactic cues do indeed affect the interpretation of ZEROS, but that having previously been the TOPIC and being realized as a ZERO also contributes to the salience of a discourse entity. We propose a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT, and show that CENTERING provides constraints on when a ZERO can be interpreted as the ZERO TOPIC.",
