The corner stone of this approach is efficient classification of Wikipedia articles to target NE classes. The resources developed were thoroughly evaluated to ensure reliability and a high quality. Results show the developed gazetteer boosts the performance of the NE classifier on a news-wire domain by at least 2 points F-measure. Moreover, by combining a learning NE classifier with the developed corpus the score achieved is a high F-measure of 85.18%. The developed resources overcome the limitations of traditional Arabic NE tasks by more fine-grained analysis and providing a beneficial route for further studies. Introduction Previous efforts that have been made to develop an Arabic NER either focused on traditional NE classes (Benajiba et al., 2010) or sought to expand only one class at a time (Shaalan and Raza, 2007) . Applications such as Question Answering (QA) receive more benefits when a fine-grained NER is developed. This is true when we consider that, the majority of factoid questions are about named entities (Noguera et al., 2005) . Having a finer NER, results in the possibility of extracting more semantic knowledge from the context. For example, if we consider the following sentence: \u202b\ufeed\ufeb3\ufe8e\ufe8b\ufede(\u202c \u202b\ufeb7\ufeae\ufedb\ufe8e\ufe95\u202c \u202b\ufe83\ufedb\ufe92\ufeae\u202c \u202b\ufeeb\ufef2\u202c \u202b\u062f\ufef3\ufeb0\ufee7\ufef2\u202c \u202b\ufeed\ufe8d\ufedf\ufe96\u202c \u202b\ufeb7\ufeae\ufedb\ufe94\u202c \u202b\ufe8d\ufedf\ufecc\ufe8e\ufedf\ufee2\u202c \u202b\ufed3\ufef2\u202c \u202b\ufeed\ufe8d\ufedf\ufe98\ufeae\ufed3\ufef4\ufeea\u202c \u202b\ufe8d\ufef9\ufecb\ufefc\ufee1\u202c /\u0161rk wAlt dyzny hy Okbr \u0161rkAt wsA\u0177l AlI\u03c2lAm wAltrfyh fy Al\u03c2Alm/ 'Walt Disney is the largest media company in the entertainment world') 1  We would have more semantic information if we could tag \u202b\u062f\ufef3\ufeb0\ufee7\ufef2(\u202c \u202b\ufeed\ufe8d\ufedf\ufe96\u202c /wAlt dyzny/ 'Walt Disney') 1 Throughout this paper, Arabic words are represented in three variants: (Arabic word /HSB transliteration scheme (Habash et al., 2007) / \"English translation\") as [ORG-ENTERTAINMENT] rather than just [ORG] . This deeper semantics is very helpful when answering factoid question like \"What is the largest entertainment company?\" Supervised machine learning technologies have been successfully adopted for several natural language tasks, including NER. These technologies require a reasonable portion of data to be accessible in the training phase, containing a number of positive and negative examples to learn from and to circumvent the problem of data sparseness. Traditional methods for compiling such data involve recruiting individuals to annotate a certain corpus manually. This is tedious work, as well as costly and time consuming. Moreover, manually annotating a large portion of a relatively open domain corpus beyond a news-wire and across various genres is not easy for an individual to achieve. Therefore, when developing a reasonable finegrained NE corpus two questions should be answered. First, what proper fine-grained semantic classes should be established? Second, how to develop a reasonable sized fine-grained NE corpus at minimum cost? This work answers those questions. To these ends the methodology we devised was designed to utilise the availability and growth of Arabic Wikipedia to develop a large and extendable finegrained named entity corpus and gazetteer with minimum human intervention. The contributions of this paper are: 1. It introduces a two-level tagset for Wikipedia NEs; 2. It develops a large fine-grained automatic NE corpus using minimum human intervention; 3. It develops a large fine-grained gazetteer; and 4. It thoroughly evaluates the resulting corpus and gazetteer. Arabic Wikipedia and Named Entity Wikipedia is an extensive collaborative project on the web in which articles are published and reviewed by volunteers from around the world. Wikipedia includes 271 different languages, with the Arabic version ranked 27th with more than 210,000 articles. The annual increase in the number of articles is 30% (Wikipedia, 2013) . The actual relationship between the Named Entity and Wikipedia is that a large percentage of Wikipedia articles are about named entities (Alotaibi and Lee, 2012) . This provided the motivation to utilise Wikipedia's underlying structure to produce the target resources. To this end, it is beneficial to provide an overview of the critical aspects of the Wikipedia structure: \u2022 Articles: These can be one of the following: 1. Normal article: Each article has a unique title and contains authentic content; i.e. textual data, images, tables, items and links, related to the concept represented in the title. These are in the majority. 2. Redirected article: These contain a specific tag to redirect the enquirer to a normal article. For example: for the redirected article titled \u202b\ufe91\ufeae\ufef3\ufec4\ufe8e\ufee7\ufef4\ufe8e(\u202c \u202b\ufe8d\ufedf\ufecc\ufec8\ufee4\ufef0\u202c /bryTAnyA Al\u03c2 \u010em\u00fd/ 'Great Britain'), there is a redirected tag to \u202b\ufe8d\ufedf\ufee4\ufe98\ufea4\ufeaa\ufe93(\u202c \u202b\ufe8d\ufedf\ufee4\ufee4\ufee0\ufedc\ufe94\u202c /Almmlk AlmtHd / 'United Kingdom'). This tag is written thus #REDIRECTED[[\u202b\ufe8d\ufedf\ufee4\ufee4\ufee0\ufedc\ufe94\u202c \u202b.]]\ufe8d\ufedf\ufee4\ufe98\ufea4\ufeaa\ufe93\u202c 3. Disambiguation article: These are used to list all the article titles that share ambiguities. \u2022 Links types: There are two types of links in Wikipedia and they are described below: 1. Non-piped links: this type of links denotes that the display phrase of the link and the article's title are the same. For example: [[London] ]. 2. Piped links: this type of link allows for the text that appears in the contextual data to be different from the actual article it refers to. For example: [[UK|United Kingdom]], where \"UK\" appears in the display text, while \"United Kingdom\" refers to the titles of the article. Throughout this paper, the terms \"link\" and \"link phrase\" are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing. \u2022 Connectivity: Used links, of any type, in the contextual data of any normal article, provide connectivity and thereby an underlying structure for Wikipedia; we are seeking to utilise to achieve our goal. Transforming Arabic Wikipedia into a Fine-grained NE corpus and Gazetteer In this section we present in detail the approach advised to automatically develop a tagged fine-grained named entity corpus and gazetteer based on Arabic Wikipedia. The Conciseness of the Approach Our assumption regarding this work is as follows: If we are able to classify Wikipedia articles into NE classes, we will then be able to map the resultant labelling back into contextualised linked phrases. This involves the following steps: 1. Defining a fine-grained taxonomy suitable to Wikipedia; 2. Classifying Arabic Wikipedia articles into a predefined set of fine-grained NE classes; 3. Mapping the results of the classification back to the linked phrases in the text; 4. Detecting successive mentions of NE that have not been associated with links, while taking into account the Arabic morphological variation of the NE phrase; and 5. Selecting sentences to be included in the final corpus. Defining Fine-grained Semantic NE Classes Sekine et al. (2002) proposed a hierarchical named entity taxonomy that is very fine, with 150 subclasses. The methodology they used to construct semantic classes relies on analysing the named entities in a newswire corpus, in addition to analysing the answer type for a set of questions used in a Text Retrieval Conference TREC-QA task. WordNet noun hierarchy is also used to shape the classes further. Two years later, Sekine and Nobat (2004) added an extra 50 classes and decomposed some classes, such as \"disease\" and numeric expression respectively. Although the spectrum of classes is very wide, the specific descriptions and definitions for each class strives to avoid overlap and ambiguity, making it difficult to define. This taxonomy has been applied to both English and Japanese. Some NLP applications, such as QA have designed their own named entity classes, based on the criteria they believe to be the most valuable. Harabagiu et al. (2003) developed a named entity recognition component in which one level consists of 20 defined fine grained classes. Knowing that factoid type questions require named entities, Li and Roth (2006) defined a fine grained taxonomy to answer certain types of questions. Although, their two layer taxonomy covered 50 fine grain classes of different types, some types were unrelated to named entities such as definition, description, manner and reason. Based on the same trend, Brunstein (2002) presented a two-level taxonomy in which 29 answer types are subdivided into 105 subtypes. Other researchers have adopted and used their taxonomy for named entity taxonomy (Nothman et al., 2008) . It is evident that there is no widely agreed fine grained taxonomy that can be directly adopted into Arabic; although ACE taxonomy is a reasonable choice in the sense that it organises granularity into two layers, i.e. coarse and fine grained. In the evaluation of ACE (2008) , the number of fine grain classes is 45. This taxonomy is designed in two levels of granularities and frequently used in the news-wire domain. Moreover, two-level taxonomy allows us to map a tagset into different traditional schemes easily, such as CoNLL or MUC. Thus, ACE (2008) taxonomy was selected and because it is designed for a news-wire domain we applied some amendments to tailor it for use in a relatively open domain corpus, such as Wikipedia. For example, there are many articles in Wikipedia about people in different subclasses, such as scientists, athletes, artists, politicians, etc. These fine classes are not included in ACE, as it only involves three sub-classes: the individual, group and indeterminate. Another modification is performed; a new class called \"Product\" is added. This modified taxonomy is presented in Table 1 . Table 1 : ACE (2008) modified taxonomy. The modified or added classes are represented with italics and asterisks Wikipedia Document Classification The aim of classifying Wikipedia articles is to produce a list of two tuples, like <article's title, fine-grained NE tag>. The following sub sections describe the steps taken to achieve this goal. Fine-grained Document Annotation and Quality Evaluation In order to classify Arabic Wikipedia articles into named entity classes, we manually annotated 4000 articles into two levels of granularity, i.e. coarse and fine grained, using the modified taxonomy shown in Table 1 . Two Arabic natives were involved in the annotation process and the inter-annotator agreement between the annotators was calculated using Kappa Statistic (Carletta, 1996) . Table 2 shows that the inter-annotator agreement was calculated for different sizes of documents, i.e. 500, 2000 and 4000. This revealed difficulties that might be encountered during the annotation process. Level Kappa: n=500 Kappa: n=2000 Kappa: n=4000 Coarse-grained 92 98 99 Fine-grained 80 95 97 Table 2 : Inter-annotator agreement in coarse and fine grained levels Features Engineering and Representation We developed our classification model relying on the set of features proposed by Alotaibi and Lee (2012) as these score 90% on the F-measure for coarse grained level. The features were: 1. Simple Features (SF): which represent the raw dataset as a simple bag of words without further processing. 2. Filtered Features (FF): involving removing the punctuation and symbols, filtering stop words and normalising digits. 3. Language-dependent Features (LF): represent the tokens in their stem form. Enhanced Language-dependent Features (ELF): involving tokenising the sentence and assigning parts of speech for each token. This allows filtering of the dataset by involving only nouns (for instance) in the classifier. In addition, we extended this set of features by extracting two more features: 1. First paragraph: Instead of just relying on the first sentence as in (Alotaibi and Lee, 2012) , we identified useful features spread across the first paragraph. 2. Bigram: By using this feature, we aim to examine the effects of the collocation of tokens. Here we added the representation of a bigram while still preserving the unigram. We represent the feature space using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). Fine-grained Document Classification Results The annotated dataset was divided into training and test at 80% and 20% respectively. We chose the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) as a probabilistic model for the classifier. In each round of the classification, we tested one set of features and selected the one that performed best. Table 3 shows the overall results for the fine-grained classification. There are three main findings. First, both classifiers tend to perform in a very similar way; therefore, in practice, use of either classifier to perform the final classification for the whole Wikipedia dataset will be expected to deliver very similar results. The second finding is that, the bigram features have little effect when different features are set. Finally, the best result for both classifiers was achieved using the ELFUni feature. Compiling the Corpus Compilation of the final corpus was achieved according to the pipeline steps as follows: 1. Prepare and extract the features for all Arabic Wikipedia datasets, according to the method presented in Section 3.3. ) is expected to be repeated in context with either the first name \u202b\ufeb3\ufecc\ufeee\u062f(\u202c /s\u03c2wd/ 'Saud') or the last name \u202b\ufe8d\ufedf\ufed4\ufef4\ufebc\ufede(\u202c /AlfySl/ 'Alfaisal') or both together. This can also be difficult when prefixes are used. For example \u202b\ufeed\ufedf\ufeb4\ufecc\ufeee\u062f(\u202c /wls\u03c2wd/ 'and for Saud'). Therefore, we prepare for and match all the variations of prefixes that can be attached to the NE. 6. Produce the NE annotated corpus by selecting sentences to be included in the final corpus. To Which Extent to Select Sentences to be Involved in the Final Corpus? We decided to compile two versions of the developed corpus. The first version is called \"WikiFANE W hole \", which means that we retrieved all the sentences from the articles. On the other hand, the second version, i.e. WikiFANE Selective , is compiled by selecting only the sentences, which have at least one named entity phrase. This creates a Wikipedia corpus that has as high a density of tags as possible. In this paper and for evaluation purposes, we compiled the corpus for more than 2 million tokens as shown in Evaluation and Results To evaluate the fine-grained NE corpus and gazetteer produced, we conducted a set of thorough experiments. The aims of the evaluation were to answer the following questions: \u2022 What is the quality of the corpus produced and the gazetteer in terms of annotation? \u2022 How efficient is the NE classifier when used with WikiFANE W hole and WikiFANE Selective and tested over cross-domain and within-domain datasets? Evaluating the Annotation Quality The performance of document classification across all Wikipedia articles is crucial to avoid error propagation from the document classification stage when compiling the final version of the annotated corpus. Therefore, the first evaluation focused on this aspect. After classifying all articles to the target NE classes, we drew another 4000 articles, to be represented as a sample for all Wikipedia articles, and manually annotated them. The selection of the articles was made by selecting the first 4000 articles with identical glyphs to those used most frequently in other Wikipedia articles. This criteria ensured that the most frequent NE were classified properly with a minimum error rate. After this, we calculated the inter-annotation agreement between the manually annotated, gold-standard documents, and that classified based on step 3 in Section 3.4. Table 6 shows the result for both levels of granularity. The overall Kappa for the fine-grained level is 82.6% and this is External knowledge features The token appears in gazeetter Table 7 : The set of language dependent and independent features extracted to be used by the classifier consistent with the results shown in Section 3.3.3. This gives the impression that, the error rate is at a minimum, even when performing the classification across all Wikipedia articles with small amounts of training data. Evaluating the Corpus Developed by Learning NE Classifier This evaluation was designed to evaluate the corpus developed by using it as training data to test it over crossdomain and within-domain datasets. Moreover, this assists evaluation of the efficiency of using gazetteer as external knowledge resource. We parsed the different datasets and tokenised the sentences using AMIRA (Diab, 2009) relying on the scheme (Conjunction + Preposition + Prefix). The concept behind using this tokenisation scheme is that, the notable sparseness issues regarding Arabic NE are caused by agglutination of the prefixes. In this scheme, we guaranteed that the named entities like \u202b\ufea7\ufe8e\ufedf\ufeaa(\u202c /xAld/ 'Khalid') in the training data also refer to \u202b\ufeed\ufedf\ufea8\ufe8e\ufedf\ufeaa(\u202c /wlxAld/ 'and for Khalid') in the test data. This happens by tokenising the words and splitting the prefixes, so the result will be three different tokens \u202b\ufeed(\u202c /w/ 'and'), \u202b\ufedd(\u202c /l/ 'for') and \u202b\ufea7\ufe8e\ufedf\ufeaa(\u202c /xAld/ 'Khalid'). We extracted traditional sets of features at different levels; including lexical, morphological, syntactical and external knowledge. Table 7 summarises the features used where a window of five features are encoded in the classifier including the current position. The following set of experiments was conducted relying on the Conditional Random Field (CRF) probabilistic model to perform the sequence labelling. In all the experiments, we divided the datasets into training and test at 80% and 20% respectively. We used the three metrics, precision, recall and F-measure, to evaluate the results. Training/DevTest (REFLEX for short), which consists of about 60K of tokens with two levels of classes. This is divided according to its origin into news-wire (NW), treebank (TB) and web blogs (WL). We used both the ANERcorp and the Arabic portion of REFLEX as goldstandard corpora to conduct the evaluation. Tags Table 8 shows the tag distribution for each corpus per class and the total per token and phrase. We use (NA) as an indication of no availability in the dataset. It is clearly shown that WikiFANE Selective has wider distributed tags compared with WikiFANE W hole . Gazetteer Evaluation Using gazetteer as an external knowledge source in NER helps to boost the performance of NER (Carreras et al., 2002) . To evaluate the gazetteer produced, we learned the classifier by news-wire dataset one at a time. Each time, we evaluated the presence and absence of WikiFANE Gazet . Due to ANERcorp dataset being coarse-grain level, we decided to map the RE-FLEX dataset to the same scheme used by ANERcorp. In addition, we eliminated the MISC class used by ANERcorp because there is no direct equivalent in REFLEX. Three main points arose from this experiment. First, the F-measure increased by at least 2 points for all datasets, showing the overall positive effect of the developed gazetteer. Second, the recall metric clearly boosted the classifier enabling retrieval of more NE phrases than would be possible without WikiFANE Gazet . Third, the TB sub-dataset of RE-FLEX showed dramatic improvement in comparison with other datasets, because that TB dataset had comparatively less noise.    To elaborate more on cross-domain evaluation we evaluated the merging of WikiFANE Selective , since it performed best in the previous experiment, with both ANERcorp and REFLEX. The idea behind this experiment was to understand how the classifier performs when different domains and genera are combined together. The most notable findings, as shown in Table 11 are that, the recall metric shows a sharp drop in all datasets. However, the precision shows high scores, suggesting the Wikipedia corpus is strong in difference when compared with the news-wire domain. Within-domain Evaluation The traditional practice of learning NE classifier is to draw the training and test datasets from single domain. Therefore, we divided WikiFANE W hole and WikiFANE Selective into training and test for 80% and 20% respectively and then training the CRF classifier on WikiFANE W hole and WikiFANE Selective separately with and without the injection of the WikiFANE Gazet as an external knowledge source. Table 12 shows that, the use of WikiFANE Gazet creates a notable improvement across datasets by at least 3 points on the F-measure. In addition, WikiFANE Selective has a slightly superiority over WikiFANE W hole advising that both datasets are performing at a promising level of accuracy. Related Work A promising trend in the research is towards automatically developing an annotated NE corpus that extends beyond both traditional classes and the domain of newswire, in order to create novel resources. One of the earliest of these approaches was presented by An et al. (2003) in which the web was used to build a target corpus, using bootstrapping to build an anno-tated NE corpus. A further approach utilises parallel corpora to build an NE corpus automatically. This relies on the suggestion that once one corpus is annotated then other parallel corpora can be easily annotated using projection. Ehrmann et al. (2011) developed multilingual NE corpora for English, French, Spanish, German and Czech. Similarly, Fu et al. (2011) developed a Chinese annotated NE corpus exploiting an English aligned corpus. The difference here is that the alignment is conducted between both corpora at the wordlevel. Beyond the newswire-based corpora, Wikipedia becomes more attractive for different NLP tasks. Some researchers have exploited the unrestricted accessibility of Wikipedia to establish an automatic fully annotated NE corpus with different granularity; meanwhile others are merely focusing on partially utilising Wikipedia to achieve specific goals, such as developing a NE gazetteer (Attia et al., 2010) or classifying Wikipedia articles into NE semantic classes (Saleh et al., 2010) . Tkatchenko et al. (2011) expanded the classification into an 18 fine-grain taxonomy extracted from (BNN). To prepare training data for use in the classification stage, a small set of seeds is constructed, as undertaken by Nadeau et al. (2006) , in which a semi-supervised bootstrapping approach was used to construct long lists of entities in different fine-grain NE classes from the web. After the list is constructed, the entities are then intersected with Wikipedia articles so as to classify each article according to its target class. Therefore, a set of 40 articles per fine-grain class was produced for use in training with the Na\u00efve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Several similar features have been selected (e.g. (Saleh et al., 2010; Dakka and Cucerzan, 2008) ). Instead of relying on machine learning, Richman and Schon Richman and Schon (2008) defined a set of heuristics involving using assigned category links to classify articles. Phrasal patterns for each semantic NE class were specified when a matching article was classified; alternatively the procedure searched the upper level of categories to find candidates. These articles are still classified according to traditional coarse grain classes. Closely related to our work are attempts to build a completely annotated NE corpus free from human in- .37 88.75 92.40 96.12 91.73 93.87 82.55 75.73 78.99 88.77 81.86 85.18 Table 12 : The result for within-domain evaluation tervention. The first attempt to transform Wikipedia into an annotated NE corpus was made by Nothman et al. (2008) ; they assumed that many NEs are associated with Wikipedia inter-links, i.e. the hyperlinks associated with a phrase in contexts pointing to another article. Therefore, the procedure first identified NEs using heuristics to exploit capitalisation, and then the target articles were classified into NE semantic classes. A bootstrapping approach is then used to extract seeds from a set of 1300 articles. Two distinguishing features were extracted per article; i.e. the head noun for the category links and the head noun for the definitional sentence. The corpus produced covered 60 fine-grained classes in two layers. An alternative approach to the same data set is presented by Tardif et al. (2009) , in which the classification relies on supervised machine learning. Like Dakka and Cucerzan (2008) , both Na\u00efve Bayes and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used as statistical interfaces for the purpose of classification. A total of 2311 articles have been manually annotated and a combination of structured and unstructured features extracted. The corpus produced by Nothman et al. (2008) has been thoroughly experimented with to evaluate the impact of its performance. Three different gold-standard corpora, i.e. MUC, CoNLL and BNN, were used for comparative purposes and separate models built for each corpus. The experiment showed that, when in conjunction with other gold-standard corpora the Wikipedia-based corpus could raise their performance; it also performs well for non-Wikipedia texts (Nothman et al., 2009) . Conclusion We presented a methodology to develop a large size fine-grained named entity corpus and gazetteer using an automatic approach. This involved recruiting document classifications. Using this methodology, we produced constantly evolving NE resources that will exploit the yearly growth rate of Arabic Wikipedia. The freely fine-grained NE corpus and gazetteer produced when used on their own are of a very promising quality and extend the scope of research beyond traditional NE tasks.",
