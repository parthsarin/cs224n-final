Our approach is based on the framework of Stacked Generalization, also known as Stacking, which is an ensemble learning algorithm, widely used in machine learning tasks. First, a collection of base-level SMTs is generated for obtaining a meta-level corpus. Then a meta-level SMT is trained on this corpus. In this paper we address the issue of how to adapt stacked generalization to SMT. We evaluate our approach on Englishto-Persian machine translation. Experimental results show that our approach leads to significant improvements in translation quality over a phrase-based baseline by about 1.1 BLEU points. Introduction Currently, there exist a number of commercial and research Machine Translation (MT) systems, which are developed under different paradigms such as rule-based, example based, statistical machine translation, trained using different algorithms, e.g., phrase-based SMT, hierarchical phrase-based SMT, syntax-based SMT with different types and amounts of training data. With the emergence of these various structurally different systems, system combination methods have taken a great importance during the past few years. There are several techniques for combining multiple SMT systems to achieve higher translation quality, e.g. sentence-level combination (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008) simply selects \"the best\" of the provided translations and phrase-level combination (Matusov et al., 2006; Rosti et al., 2007) can generate new translations differing from all original translations. Most of the state-of-the-art SMT system combination methods require multiple SMT systems based on different models. Since it is not easy to have multiple SMT systems, in this work we focus on applying stacking algorithm on a single SMT system rather than multiple SMT systems. We try to increase the performance of an SMT system by introducing a meta-level SMT which can learn how to decrease or modify translation errors on the translation outputs of original SMT system. This task is also known as automatic post-editing (APE) which is a well-studied topic in machine translation community (Simard et al., 2007a; B\u00e9chara et al., 2011) . To do this, we use stacked generalization which is an ensemble learning algorithm Ensemble Learning is a machine learning paradigm where multiple learners are trained to solve the same problem. An ensemble is viewed as a collection of learners which are usually called base learners. Base learners are usually generated from training data by a base learning algorithm which can be decision tree, neural network or other kinds of machine learning algorithms. Most ensemble methods use a single base learning algorithm to produce homogeneous base learners, but there are also some methods which use multiple learning algorithms to produce heterogeneous learners. The concept of ensembles appeared in classification literature has subsequently been studied in several frameworks, including stacked generalization (Wolpert, 1992) , bagging (Breiman, 1996b) , boosting (Scharpire, 1990) , model averaging (Perrone et al., 1993) , forecast combining (Granger, 1989 ) and so on. Previous work have tried to introduce some of these frameworks into SMT (Xiao et al., 2010) , none of them adapt stacked generalization to SMT. While stacked generalization has been extensively investigated in machine learning, its adaption to SMT is not a trivial task. In this paper, we show how to make stacked generalization work for a single SMT system. Stacked generalization is a general method of using a meta-level model to combine base-level models to achieve higher accuracy. However, this algorithm is introduced for combining multiple models, we focus our attention to utilize this algorithm in order to improve only a single SMT system. The basic idea of stacked generalization is to perform cross-validation on the base-level dataset in order to create a meta-level dataset. Then a meta-level model is trained on it. Finally, this system can generate better outputs than original system that is trained on the whole original dataset. Background Given a source sentence s , the goal of SMT is to find a target sentence t among all possible target strings 1 t , that maximizes the probability: t is a machine translation for s . In meta-SMT, a monolingual two-side corpus consists of these machine translations along with correct human translations. So, given a machinery output t , the goal of meta-SMT is to find a target sentence t \u02c6, that maximizes this probability: )} | ( pr { max )} | ( pr { max arg \u02c62 2 t t t t = Where ) | ( pr 2 t t is the probability that 2 t is the correct final translation of the given machine translated string t and both of 2 t and t are in the same language. The target sentence t \u02c6 is a final machine translation for s . In the next section, we are going to describe stacked generalization for classification tasks and in section 3, we present a general solution to adapting this algorithm to SMT. Stacking for Classification Wolpert (1992) introduced a novel approach for combining multiple classifiers, known as stacked generalization or stacking. The key idea is to learn a meta-level (or level-1) classifier based on the output of base-level (or level-0) classifiers, estimated via cross-validation as follows: Define } ,..., 1 ), , {( K i y x D i i = = as a data set , also referred to as level-0 data, where i x is a feature vector representing the n th instance and At the end of the entire cross-validation process, the union U j j J j MD MD ... 1 , = = , constitutes the full meta-level data set, also referred to as level-1 data, which is used for applying a learning algorithm M L and inducing the metalevel classifier M C . The learning algorithm that is employed at meta-level could be one of the  form a meta-level vector that is assigned a class value by the metalevel classifier M C . In the next section we adapt this framework to SMT. Adapting Stacking to SMT Stacking is composed of two phases and we adapt it to SMT as follows: First, a typical SMT paradigm is trained using J-fold cross-validation based on a bilingual cor- . Then, the nbest outputs of these systems are collected to create a new corpus called meta-level corpus MD . For example, if we have a training corpus of N sentences and we use 3-best outputs of each system in cross-validation process, the effective size of the meta-level corpus will be N \u00d7 3 . In this new corpus, all the generated translations from the source sentences are paired to correct human translations. Second, this corpus is used with another SMT paradigm -we call it meta-SMT-that could be identical to the SMT paradigm we used in crossvalidation process or another SMT paradigm, in order to provide the final translation. In this algorithm, any SMT paradigm could be used in baselevel and meta-level SMTs such as phrase-based SMT, hierarchical phrase-based SMT and syntax-based SMT. In this work, we utilize a phrasebased SMT for both base-level and meta-level. We use a phrase-based model for meta-level SMT, because we are supposed to improve a single SMT system. In addition, we train another phrase-based SMT based on full training set to produce target 1-best outputs and then use these outputs as input test set for meta-level SMT. Figure 1 (left side) illustrates the crossvalidation methodology, while Figure 1 (right side) illustrates the stacking framework at runtime. Figure 2 also shows the algorithm in details. Training base-level SMTs After splitting the whole training corpus to separate training and test sets during cross-validation process, we train 5 phrase-based SMT systems on the training part and obtain the result of these systems on the corresponding test sets. We need these results for the next step. Training meta-level SMTs We gathered the n-best outputs of base-level SMTs on the corresponding test sets and built a meta-level corpus using these outputs along with correct human translations which was available from our original corpus. Then a meta-level SMT is trained on this corpus. We train our meta-SMT system on 10 meta-level corpus which is progressively created from n-best outputs of baselevel systems, 10 ,..., 1 = n ; i.e. each meta-level corpus that is created from n-best list also contains ) 1 ... 1 ( \u2212 n -best list. In the results, we call these systems as meta-SMT (1-best) and meta-SMT (2-best) and so on. Tuning meta-level SMTs We must tune our meta-SMTs in a principled way. Similar to the training step, after splitting the whole tuning corpus to separate tuning and test sets during cross-validation process, we tune 5 base-level SMT systems on the tuning part and obtain the result of these systems on the corresponding test sets. Finally a meta-level development set is created by gathering these outputs paired with correct human translations to tune meta-level SMTs. Experiments Data The corpus that is used for training and crossvalidation process is Verbmobil project corpus which includes some tourists' conversations about time scheduling and appointment settings in German and English (Ney, 2000) . Then a large part of English sentences are translated to Persian by human translators to build an English-Persian corpus (Bakhshaei et al., 2010) . This dataset includes 23K lines in both sides, 249K and 216K words in Persian and English sides, respectively. We have chosen this corpus because it is small enough to perform cross-validation. Experimental Setup We use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) to perform the bi-directional word alignment between source and target side of each sentence pair. The final word alignment is generated using the grow-diag-final-and symmetrizing strategy. To speed up alignment, all the sentences with more than 80 words are removed. A 3-gram language model is trained on the target side of the bilingual data using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) . The translation quality is evaluated in terms of case-insensitive BLEU metric. We have run a phrase-based statistical machine translation with the Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) to build baseline, base-level and meta-level SMTs. We use MERT (Och, 2003) to tune the feature weights on the development data. Evaluation We investigate the effectiveness of our approach on improving a phrase-based SMT system. BLEU scores are computed on 250 test sentences    with four reference translations. Table 1 shows the results of our approach against baseline SMT on the test set. We see that almost all meta-SMTs are achieved over 0.5 BLEU improvement on the test set. The biggest improvement is obtained by meta-SMT (10-best) by 1.07 BLEU improvement. Moreover, we see a similar behavior of our approach on the development set. Considering the results on the development set, meta-SMT (4best) and meta-SMT (8-best) will be good choices for meta-level SMT. While these results are very encouraging, we must investigate why this approach is helpful. We find that two factors possibly contribute to these results. first, performing cross-validation on the training set; second, and possibly more importantly, the re-optimization on the system. In order to verify whether the improvements are due to the cross-validation or re-optimizing, we perform two experiments. The first is to test this approach without any cross-validation process, but with the development set obtained from stacking. It means that all source side sentences of the training corpus are translated by using an SMT system that is trained on the bilingual same corpus. This experiment is referred to as Straight1 in the results. The second is to build meta-level SMTs tuned with a development set which is obtained directly from baseline SMT (i.e., without performing cross-validation on it. This experiment is referred to as Straight2 in the results. A comparison between the results of the three settings (Stacking, Straight1 and Straight2) is shown in Figure 3 . The figure shows BLEU curve on the test set, where the X-axis is the number of base-level outputs (n-best) that is used to create meta-level corpus for meta-SMT, and the Y-axis is the BLEU scores of the final meta-SMT calculated from each approach. After analyzing the results, it can be concluded that both factors, i.e., cross-validation and re-optimizing the system with the stacking-based development set, are important to outperform the baseline SMT system. Since use of both factors, consistently lead to the best results. In all of the experiments, the size of the n-best list varies from 1 up to 10. The main reason for the upper limit is just that the experiments are very time consuming. We conducted statistical significance tests using paired bootstrap resampling proposed by Koehn (2004) to measure the reliability of the conclusion that meta-SMTs are really better than baseline SMT. It is observed that all stackingbased meta-SMTs are really better than the baseline SMT in 99% of the times. Related Work Stacking is a machine learning (ML) algorithm that is a well-studied topic in the ML community (Wolpert, 1992; Breiman, 1996a) , and has been successfully adapted in natural language processing and information retrieval , such as named entity recognition (Wu et al., 2003) and Information extraction (Sigletos et al., 2005) . There are also some researches on applying ensemble learning algorithms into SMT. Xiao et al. (2010) presented a general solution for adaption of bagging and boosting to SMT. The results of their work showed that ensemble learning algorithms are promising in SMT. Most other researches are in the statistical post-editing (SPE) techniques which have been used successfully to improve the output of Rule- Based MT (RBMT) systems. Simard et al. (2007a) , trained a \"mono-lingual\" Phrase-based SMT system (the Portage system) on the output of an RBMT system for the source side of the training set of the Phrase-based SMT system and the corresponding human translated (manually post-edited) reference. More recently, B\u00e9chara et al. (2011) designed a full phrase-based SMT pipeline that included a translation step and a post-editing step. The authors report significant improvements of 2 BLEU points for a French to English translation task, using a novel context aware approach. This method takes into account the source sentences during the post-editing process through a word-to-word alignment between the source words and the target words generated by the translation system. As far as we are aware, the research presented in this paper is the first attempt to apply stacking algorithm to SMT with the configuration presented. Conclusion and Future Work We have presented a simple and effective approach to translation error modification by building a meta-level SMT using a meta-level corpus that is created form original corpus by cross validation. Experimental results showed that such a meta-SMT can fix many translation errors that occur in the baseline translations. The proposed method outperforms the baseline SMT on the same test set. We also believe that stacked generalization can be used to combine multiple SMT systems. As a future work, we have planned to develop a technique for combining multiple SMT systems using stacked generalization algorithm. Moreover, we are running more tests with different language-pairs and larger corpora. We also have planned to use the confusion network methods on the input of meta-level SMTs, so that the meta-SMT can translate a confusion network built based on the n-best output of baseline SMT. As another future work, we will apply our framework under different SMT paradigms such as hierarchical phrase-based SMT and syntaxbased SMT.
