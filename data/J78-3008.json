W e a r e a l l familiar with t h e phrase \"beauty i s i n t h e eye o f t h e beholder.\" In t h i s c a s e we have an instance of \"the disease i s i n the eye o f t h e beholder\" which o f course explains why t h e cure is s o e l u s i v e . The beholder r a r e l y wants t o do anything about i t . To d i s c u s s t h i s more s u b j e c t i v e l y , l e t ' s take a n e u t r a l case. Before doing s o , we s h a l l have t o point out what a case can be expected t o look l i k e . A case o f \"ad hocness\" usually f i t s t h e foitro (or should I say t h e \"ad hoc\" form) T k o r y X i s called \"ad hoc\" by group t d t h r i v a l theory Y The research described i n t h i s paper was supported by t h e Advanced Research P r o j e c t s Agency o f t h e Department o f Defense and monitored by t h e Office ~\\ 5 Naval Research under c o n t r a c t N00014-75-C-1111. To g e t t o our n e u t r a l c a s e , we s h a l l start! our d i s c u s s i o n where X i s Conceptual Dependency and Y i s Transformational Generative Grammar. Be fore I begin, I should note t h a t t h e r e a r e conditions on X and Y r e l a t i v e t o each g t h e r , namely t h a t X must be a theory t h a t has been conceived a t a d d t e l a t e r than Y was conceived6 Furthermore Y should have been . dominating some academic f i e l d which X i s seeking to invade. What makes a theory X a s s a i l a b l e by Y a s ad hoc? There a r e a number o f c r i t e r i a : 1 -X must explain a phenomenon that Y chose t o ignore and t h a t Y would r a t h e r go on ignoring Since Y c b d d not p s s i b l y e x p l a i n i t . 2 -X must be fundamentally a t variance with Y , s o t h a t i f X were r i g h t Y would be n e c e s s a r i l y wrong. -X must ~d e d i f f e r e n t c r i t e r i a o f judgment of how a phenomena should be explained than Y does. The following rules a r e used f o r the s t r a t e g y t o be followed i n l a b e l l i n g an X a s ad hoc: 1 -Since X w i l l undoubtedly show how i t s t h e o r y e x p l a i n s a given p a r t i c u l a r phenomenon, accuse X s theory o f only working i n t h a t case. This w i l l put t h e burden o f proof f o r g e n e r a l i t y on X r a t h e r than Y and a l s o has t h e d e s i r a b l e e f f e c t o f puttink X i n the p o s i t i o n of not being a b l e t o prove anything with out proving everything. To what e x t e n t a r e these charges v a l i d ? - To not knowiq i f one can e x t r a c t a c o n c e p t u a l i z a t i o n from any sentence (and i t s corroborating charge o f not provinpl that t h e r e e x i s t s a r i g h t CU diagram f o r any sentence) I plead g u i l t y . But o f course, I would be less than completely honest i f I d i d not a l s o note t h a t t h e r e does nbt e x i s t any t h e o r y o r t h e o r i s t who m u l d not a l s o have t o plead g u i l t y . Have the t r a n s f o r m a t i o n a l i s t s shown us t h a t they have some principled way o f e x t r a c t i n g conceptualizations from sentences o r determining t h e c o r r e c t r e p r e s e n t a t i o n for any sentence? Unless they a r e keeping t h e i r s o l u t i q n as a s e c r e t plan not' t o be revealed u n t i l a f t e r t h e e l e c t i o n , I would have to imagine t h a t the answer t o t h i s i s t h a t they do not have a s o l u t i o n t o t h e problem. So c l e a r l y , t h e y are no more o r l e s s ad hoc than w a r e . (Of course I m i g h t note here t h a t we do have programs t h a t suggest t h a t we can db a l a r g e c l a s s o f examples and show t h a t our p a r s e r s a r e a t least t h e beginning of some set of p r i n c i p l e s that work, but I won t ) . What about Weizenbaum s a t t a c k ? Perhaps i t i s a l l h e u r i s t i c s . To t h i s charge I plead no c o n t e s t . It might be that, i n the end, we w i l l have b u i l t a working program t h a t s o l v e s t h e e n t i r e n a t u r a l language problem and i t w i l l be e a s i l y l a b e l l e d a s a grand set o f h e u r i s t i c s .

PART I11 J u s t t o g i v e the r e a d e r a f e e l f o r t h e n a t u r e o f ad hoc t h i n k l a g i n A 1 t h a t I b e l i e v e t o be worth espousing, I w i l l now consider a problem t h a t I have r e c e n t l y been working on. W e have had a problem i n r e p r e s e n t i n g c e r t a i n kinds o f p o l i t i c a l concepts i n our o l d r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . Since we have been v e r y concerned with t h e problem of newspaper s t o r y understanding i t i s very important t h a t we b e a b l e t o handle such concepts i n a c l e a n r e p r e s e n t a t i o n that w i l l f a c i l i t a t e computer understanding. The problem w e a r e attempting t o s o l v e can b e i l l u s t r a t e d by looking a t a recent New York Times h e a d l i n e \"Catawba Indians land claim supported.\" The problem h e r e i s t o be a b l e t o r e p r e s e n t what \"land claim\" and \"supported\" mean. W e know t h a t a land claim i s more than what we might use t o Something l i k e \"Indians MTRANS land be possessed by Indians\" is possibly t r u e , but 'it misses t h e point. A \"land claim\" i s i n a sense a p e t i t i o n t o 4 higher a u t h o r i t y t o resolve a d i s p u t e b e t w e n t w o patties. That is, t h e Indians a r e saying t o the U.S. Government, \" t h i s land i s OWS\". It may not be possible t o i n f e r t h e p a r t i c u l a r s of t h i s land claim. Indians have been known t o take the land by f o r c e , t o ' f i l e documents i n government o f f i c e s , t o Cromplain t o newsmen and so on. The important point here i s tat we r e a l l y need not know, and i n most cases a reader muld not bother t o worry about, e x a c t l y which method has been selected. Rather, a reader f e e l s t h a t he understands such a sentence when he has been a b l e t o i d e n t i f y t h e r e l a t i o n s h i p s and aims o f t h e p a r t i e s involved. A program must recognize &hat a \"land claim1' i s a type of p e t i t i o n t o a higher a u t h o r i t y t o resolve a d i s p u t e about land ownership. W e do not know who presently owns t h e land, but we know enough about ownersh3,p o f property t o i n f e r t h a t t h e r e i s probably a counter p e t i t i o n o f some s o r t . W e a l s o know about p e t i t i o n s t o a u t h o r i t y , They u s u a l l y g e t resolved by t h e a u t h o r i t y . In t h i s case then, \"supported\" r e f e r s t o the d e c i s i o n o f t h e a u t h o r i t y i n the case. This information can be represented g r a p h i c a l l y by a k n a of t r i a n g l e (example 1) Burma Tha il ahd (3) John complained t o B i l l ' s mother t h a t Bill h i t him.

(2) a n t ( 3). t h a t t h e s i m i l a r i t y must b e represented i n some way, and t h a t that s i m i l a r f t y can be exploited f o r use i n an understanding system. The f i r s t r e p r e s e n t a t i o n a l problem w e encounter i n t r y i n g t o make e x p l i c i t much of what i s i m p l i c i t i n the t r i a n g l e r e p r e s e n t a t i o n i s t h a t we will need t o design a new set o f ACTS t o take. c a r e o f t h e v a r i o u s r e l a t i o n s h i p s . In the pr i m i t i v e ACTS o f Conceptual Dependency we have a system t h a t r e p r e s e n t s physical a c t i o n s by using a m a l l s e t of b a s i c a c t i o n s t h a t can combine i n v a r i o u s ways t o d e s c r i b e d e t a i l e d or complex a c t i o n s that underlie seemingly simple Verbs and nouns. The primitive ACTs do not account f o r i n t e n t i o n a l i t y and g o a l s underlying physical a d t i o o . To account f o r such t h i n g s w e devised a complex apparatus discussed i n Schank and Abelson (1977) . If we wish t o account f o r s o c i a l e v e n t s , we will need a system of b a s i c s o c i a l ACTs t o represent t h e s o c i a l a c t i o n s t h a t comprise the events. I term these \"basit s o c i a l ACTS\" r a t h e r than p r i m i t i v e ACTs because i n t h e end most s o c i a l ACTS have some phys$cal m a n i f e s t a t i o a , Of t e n t h e i r physical manifestation i s u n i n t e r e s t i n g however. For example a goverment d e c i s i o n may be MTRANS-ed i n a v a r i e t y of ways. The manner o f the MTRANS* ( w r i t t e n , ar)nounced i n a speech. e t c ) i s o f t e n not s i g n i f i c a n t with respect t o the o v e r a l l s o c i a l e f f e c t o f t h e a c t i o n . Furthermore the MTRAbJS i t s e l f i s o n l y s l i g h t l y i n t e r e s t i n g . The standard i n f e r e n c e s from MTRANS a p p l y , but t h e r e a r e some h i g h l y s i g n i f i c a n t inferences t h a t need t o be made t h a t a r e not obviously a v a i l a b l e . For example, t h e most s i g n i f i c a n t i n f e r e n c e t o be made from an a u t h o r i t y ' s d e c i s i o n i s t h a t simply by virtue o f that decision something has a c t u a l l y happened. That i s , a government a u t h o r i z a t i o n is a truly p e r f o r m a t i ~e ACT. Thus, i f t h e government says some property i s mine. o r t h a t a man-i s a c r i m i n a l , then i t i s so by v i r t u e a f t h e i r saying i t , S i m i l a r l y o t h e r a u t h o r i t y f i g u r e s have the same peer, A professor can say a t h e s i s is finished and a student has a Ph.D. and t h e s e t h i n g s a r e the c a s e by v i r t u e o f h i s saying i t . Not a l l a u t h o r i t y ' s d e c i s i o n s a r e like t h i s t o be sure* Sometimes an a u t h o r i t y g i v e s an o r d e r and t h a t order must be c a r r i e The v e r b 'order' means toMTRANS t o someone that they must do a p a r t i c u l a r a c t i o n o r face some ( u s u a l l y i m p l i c i t ) conseqyence . Thus, i m p l i c i t i n t h e verb 'order' but e x p l i c i t i n the CD r e p r e s e n t a t i o n f o r 'ordet', is t h e idea t h a t if t h e required ACT i s not perfomed then someone w i l l possibly do somethiq t o harm the r e c i p i e n t o f t h e order i n some way. This implied punisharent i s a p a r t o f t h e concept 'order' but i s i t necessary t h a t we t h i n k of i t each time t h a t ~JE! understand an order t o have taken place? The same question can be asked with respect t o m t h o r i z e . W e understand what a u t h o r i z a t i o n or governmental d e c i s i o n i s , but we need not access a l l t h a t information each time we understand the wlord. Consider t h e problem o f explaining the meaning of these mrds t o a c h i l d f o r example. Et i s very d i f f i c u l t t o explain them p r e c i s e l y because they a r e so complicated a t the l e v e l of physical primttive ACls Yet these i d e a s a r e r e a l l y not complicated at a l l a t a s o c i a l l e v e l of ACTs. Such simple cgncepts such a s ORDER and AUTHaIZE form the basis sf t h e organization o f s o c i e t i e s . What i s complex a t one l e v e l is simple a t another. ThiS idea o f nested l e v e l s of complectity, each wLth t h e i r own set of primitives, i s a very important one f o r the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n o f information i n a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e . By choosing a good The main d i f f e r e n c e i s t h a t these b a s i c a o c i a l ACTS are not primitive i n t h e same sense. They can be broken down but w e muld r a r e l y choose to do so. The use o f these new b a s i c ACTs i s much l i k e t h e dse o f t h e o r i g i n a l primitive ACTs. W e can p r e d i c t what will f i l l s l o t s reasonably i n a concephralization and make Inferences about s l o t f i l l e r s and consequent inferences a s we would any conceptualization. Thus represent sentences such a s the following using AmH The straightforward inference from (4) then is t h a t someone practicing s e e e g a t i o n &an expect t o be punished. Policemen are, a u t h o r i t i e s a l s o .

Triangles provide us with a new s e t o f i n f e r e n c e rules probiding more power t o the understanding system. Are they ad b c ? O f course t h e y a r e . M y point i s simply t h a t such ad hoe mechanisms w i l l e i t h e r solve the problem o r help us c r e a t e a more g e n e r a l s o l u t i o n that w i l l solve the problem. The pro4ram that we a r e w r i t i n g t h a t uses t r i a n g l e s i s a l s o ad l a c . Is i s a kludge' No. I f i t were i t wouldn't be worth a t h i n g . But, h e r e a g a i n * i f the program we write can handle many examples a s we r e w r i t e i t because o f what w e have learned from i t , then it w r l l hav beeh m r t h w h i l e . The program below r e a d s newspaper headlines i n English and g e n e r a t e s , by use o f t r i a n g l e s and t h e i n f e r e n c e s a v a i l a b l e from t r i a n g l e s , a paraphrase o f t h e input. This EngUah paraphrase i s generated by the program. The Catawba Indians a s k d a Federal Court t o rule t h a t t h e y own the land. The Catawba Indians requested a Federal Court t o r u l e that t h e land is owned by t hem. The Catawba Indians appealed t o a Federal Court. The Catawba Indians asked a Federal Court t o rule t h a t t h e y own t h e land and it decreeed t h a t t h e land is owned by them, [ Generating i n f e r e n c e s from CON4 ] > (TELL-S TORY ) The Catawba Indians and the o t h e r p a r t i e s disagreed over t h e ownership o f t h e land. The Catawba Indians requested a Federal Court t o r u l e t h a t t h e y own t h e land. A Federal Court decided thatt t h e land i s owned by t h e Catawba Indians. The o t h e r p a r t i e s w i l l probably appeal t h e d e c i s i o n .
