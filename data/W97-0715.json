The framework we propose offers a variety of subtle parameters on which scalable text summarlzahon can be based Introduction From its very begmmng, the development of text understanding systems has been mhmately trod to the field of knowledge representahon and reasoning methods (Schank ~ Abelson 77) ThLs close relationship was justtfied by the observation that any adequate form of text understanding not only reqmres grammatical knowledge about the particular language, but also, among others, has to incorporate knowledge about the dommn the text deals with Thus, the referencing capabdltms of knowledge representation languages were conmdered crucial for any adequate design of text understanding systems Out of thLs tradlhon a series of knowledge-based text summarizahon systems evolved, the methodology of whlch was almost exclnslvely based on. the Schanklan-type of Conceptual Dependency (CD) representations (e g, (Culhngford 78, Lehnert 81, DeJong 82, Dyer. 83, Trot 85, Alterman 86 )) CD representations, however, are formally underspeclfled representation devices lacking any serious formal foundatlon According to thin, the summanzahon operatlons these first-generatlon systems provide use only informal heurlshcs to determine the sahent top-Ics from the text representahon structures for the purpose of summanzatlon A second generahon of summarlzahon systems then adapted a more mature knowledge representahon approach, one based on the evolvlng methodolo~cM framework of hybrid, dasslficatlon-based knowledge representahon languages (cf (Woods & Schmolze 92) for a survey) Among these systems count SUSY (Fum et al 85) , SCISOR (Ran 87), and TOPIC (Rennet & Hahn 88) , but even m these frameworks no attempt was made to properly integrate the text summarlzahon processmto the formal reasomag mechanmms of the underlying knowledge representahon language Thin m where our interest comes in We propose here. a model of text summarlzatlon that m entirely embedded m the framework of a clasmficatlon-based model of termmologlcal reasoning Text summarlzahon m conmdered a formally gulded transformation process on knowledge representahon structures, the so-called text knowledge base, as derived by a natural language text parser The transformahons revolved inherit the formal rigor of the underly-Ing knowledge representatlon model, as correspondmg summarlzahon operators bmld on that model Thus, our work describes a methodologlcally coherent, representahon-theory-based approach to text summarlzahon that has been lacking m the hterature so far (for a survey cf (Hutchms 87)) Aside from these purely representahonal conslderahons, the terminological reasoning framework for the summanzatlon model we propose offers a variety of subtle parameters on whlch scalable summarization processes can be based Thin contrasts, m particular, wlth those approaches to text summanzahon whlch almost entlrely rely upon bmlt-m features of frame and scrlpt-based representatlons and, consequently, provide rather mmpie reduction heunstxcs m order to produce text summarms (e g, (DeJong 82, Young Hayes 85)) The formal model we present has been tested m TOPIC (Re!met & Hahn 88), a text sum-manzat~an system Which has been apphed to expos-~tory texts m the domain of computer eqmpment as well as to various kinds of texts dealing with legal lssUes (company regulations, adwsory texts, etc ) This paper m organized as follows In Section 2 we lay down a description of the syntax and semantics of the terminological logic which serves as the formal backbone for the specification of condensation operators on (text) knowledge bases From thin formal descnptmn we then turn to the formal model of text summarization m Section 3 The Terminological Knowledge Representation Model In the following, we describe a subset of a terminological logic (for an introduction to ~ts underlying basic notatlonal conventions, cf (Woods & Schmolze 92)) Sectmn 2 1 considers the terminological component, whde Section 2 2 deals with appropriate extensions for representing text-specific knowledge ( tcono-|ntro) (tc-ezpr) --= (conc-name) ~_T (and (conc-name) (tc-expr) +) (exist-v.~vrop.name) (value) (flag)) [ (exSst-c (~el-na,~) (~on~-na~e) (flag)) l (ccount (awe,ght) ) ! pcount ~rop-name) (mve,ght)) [ rcount (rel-name) (conc-name) (awesght) ) Add~tlonal Termmologlcal Constructs for Representing Text Knowledge by the syntax \u2022 Properties of a new concept can be learned (exlst-v construct) \u2022 Relationships to other concepts can be learned (exlst-c construct) m case the relatlonshlp range m already defined by a corresponding all-r construct The text-knowledge-specflic versions of the exist-v and exist-c constructs have an additional argument whlch serves as a flag that is set whenever one of these constructs is added to a concept descnptlon 0 e, when the assoclated property or relatlonshlp has been learned) The text condensatmn component of TOPIC makes use of tlns flag m or-. der to determine those facts whlch have been learned since a certain reference point (where all flags were set to 0) Besides acqmrmg new domain knowledge from a text, the parser performs book-keeping activities In order to record how often a concept, a property of a concept, or a relatmnslnp to another concept m explicitly or tmphcltly mentioned In the text For this purpose, we provide the constructs ccount, pcount, and rcount for concept descriptions These constructs belong to the text knowledge and can be apphed to concept descriptions derived from the text as well as to concepts of the dommn knowledge The ccount (pcount) construct indicates how often (a property of) a concept has been mentioned, whereas (rcount re/conc awe,ght) indicates how often the relationship tel to a concept shifts occur predominantly at paragraph boundaries Therefore, text condensation is started at the end of every paragraph so that thematic overlaps as well as topic breaks between adjacent paragraphs can be detected and the extension of a topic be exactly dehmlted The condensatmn process ymlds a set of topic descr~pt=ons, each one charactenzmg one or more adjacent paragraphs of the text (cf Section 3 2) Finally, the entire collection of topic descriptions of a single text can be generahzed m terms of a hmrarchlcal tezt graph (cf Section3 3), the representatmn form of a text summary Condensation Operators We apply several operators to text knowledge bases to detenmne which concepts, properties, and-relationships play a dominant role m the corresponding texts and thus should become part of their topic description All of these operators are grounded m the semantics of the underlying terminological logic Some of the operators make addltmnal use of cut-off values which are heurmtlcally motwated and have been evaluated emptrically Salient Concepts: There are several criteria to determine salient con-cepts The most simple, less \"knowledgeable\" criterion conmders all those concepts sahent whose activation weight exceeds the average actwatlon weight of all active concepts 1 A second criterion renders a concept sahent, ff the total sum of references made to propertms of It and to relationships to other concepts.m greater than it m, on the average, the case for all other active concepts (SC1) exploits the structure of the aggregation luerarchy and evaluates it by the associated actwation weights (for the defimtmns of sets and functions we use below, cf Table 1 ) (SC1) c m a sahent concept tff E E c,EAC rp~ERuP IIACIt Wlnle (SC1) checks the total number of references made to any property or relationship, (SC2) m concerned with the number of dsfferent Propertms and relationships mentioned \u2022 1Throughout the paper, we call a concept c an active one, tf ccount(c) > 0 (cf Table 1 )  tlACll Th e following two cnterm explozt the inherent speclalzzatmn structure of concept hzerarchzes (cf also (Lm 95 ) for a slmzlar perspectwe on using semantm generalzzatmn relatmns for the computatmn of concept salmnce) They thus resemble criteria as used for the defimtmn of macro rules to achmve summanes of texts(Correzra 80, D~k 80, Fum et al 85) These criteria also incorporate some notmn of graph connectzvzty that has previously been conszdered by (Lehnert 81 ) for text summarLzatmn purposes (SC3) determines an actwe concept c as bemg salmnt sff a slgmficant amount of subordinates of c are actwe, too (SC4)zs szmflar but zt marks all non-actzve (t) concepts as being salmnt winch are related to a

excludes concepts for whmh the main criterion zs fulfilled, but which are superorchnate to another concept that also fulfills the criterion Lastly, (SC4) has a more stnngent cut-off criterion Tins m necessary because zt makes non-actwe concepts sahent, accordingly, one has to be careful not to include ]rrelevant concepts Therefore, (SC4) reqmres a quarter of all subordinates (at least 3) to be actwe, whzle (SC3) has a relatwe cut-off, value winch gives lower percentages for greater numbers of subordinates (the cut-off values have been determined empmcally) (SC3) c is a salzent concept flf

dsscnptlons tdl, ,tdn, each one charactenzmg the topic of one or more adjacent paragraphs To every topic description td, we assomate the corresp0ndmg text passage and the facts acqmred from it We call the resulting compound structure, m which drfferent meclla combine, a (byper)text conststuent The Text Graph From the topic description contained m a text constituent, more generic constituents can be demved m terms of a hierarchy of toplc descnptlons, forming a text graph The construction of a text graph proceeds from the examination of every palr of basic topic descriptions and takes thelr conceptual commonalitms to generate more generic thematic characterlzatlons Exhaustively applying this procedure (also taking the newly generated topic abstractions Related Work The task dommn of text summarization is characterized by a ~clash of cwshzatwns\" From the point of view of natural language understanding proper (Schank & Abelson 77, Dyer 83) it ts considered a heavdy knowledge-based task reqmnng a substantial knowledge background In the field of mformahon retneval, however, the corresponding task of automahc abstracting, has been considered from Its very beganmng (Luhn 58 ), a problem that can be dealt with by surface-level pattern matching techmques and statLshcal methods originally developed for lexlcal selection tasks such as automahc mdeydng or classlficahon (Salton et al 94) Thin approach has recently been given a lot of attenhon agaan, mmnly due to the renamsance of statlshcal methodology m the field of parsing and tagging (Kuplec 95) Given a stahstlcal approach, however, automahc abstracting bods down to a sentence extrachon problem, vsz deterrrmnmg the most salient sentences based on surface-level lexlcal or positional lndicatom We adhere to the knowledge-based paradigm of abstractmg and propose to fully integrate text knowledge abstraction m a terminological reasonmg model In such an approach, text understanding and summarlzatton are considered within a formally homogeneous framework Moreover, and most important, this model allows for a staged provmon of mformatwn m summaries based on conceptual criteria (as illustrated by the chscusslon of text graphs) Such a funchonallty is unhkely to be achieved by surface-oriented approaches due to their inherent hmltahons to provide cohesive summaries from large sets of extracted sentences (Pmce 90) Conclusions We have \u2022 introduced an approach to text summarlzatlon which m sohdly rooted m the formal semantics of the underlying terminological representahon system In tins approach, text summanzahon is an operator-based transformation process on knowledge representahon structures that have been derived by the text understanding system Currently, the summanzatlon process considers only activity and connectlvlty patterns m the text knowledge base In the future, we plan to augment these criteria and to ex-plmt text coherence patterns for summarization (cf (Hahn 90 ) and related proposals by (Alterman 86 )) The zmplementahon of the summarization system and Its associated text understemder have proved functional with expository texts m the domenn of Information technology as well as with texts from the legal and business domains",
