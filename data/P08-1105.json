    "article": "Topical blog post retrieval is the task of ranking blog posts with respect to their relevance for a given topic. To improve topical blog post retrieval we incorporate textual credibility indicators in the retrieval process. We consider two groups of indicators: post level (determined using information about individual blog posts only) and blog level (determined using information from the underlying blogs). We describe how to estimate these indicators and how to integrate them into a retrieval approach based on language models. Experiments on the TREC Blog track test set show that both groups of credibility indicators significantly improve retrieval effectiveness; the best performance is achieved when combining them. Introduction The growing amount of user generated content available online creates new challenges for the information retrieval (IR) community, in terms of search and analysis tasks for this type of content. The introduction of a blog retrieval track at TREC (Ounis et al., 2007) has created a platform where we can begin to address these challenges. During the 2006 edition of the track, two types of blog post retrieval were considered: topical (retrieve posts about a topic) and opinionated (retrieve opinionated posts about a topic). Here, we consider the former task. Blogs and blog posts offer unique features that may be exploited for retrieval purposes. E.g., Mishne (2007b) incorporates time in a blog post retrieval model to account for the fact that many blog queries and posts are a response to a news event (Mishne and de Rijke, 2006) . Data quality is an issue with blogs-the quality of posts ranges from low to edited news article-like. Some approaches to post retrieval use indirect quality mea-sures (e.g., elaborate spam filtering (Java et al., 2007) or counting inlinks (Mishne, 2007a) ). Few systems turn the credibility (Metzger, 2007) of blog posts into an aspect that can benefit the retrieval process. Our hypothesis is that more credible blog posts are preferred by searchers. The idea of using credibility in the blogosphere is not new: Rubin and Liddy (2006) define a framework for assessing blog credibility, consisting of four main categories: blogger's expertise and offline identity disclosure; blogger's trustworthiness and value system; information quality; and appeals and triggers of a personal nature. Under these four categories the authors list a large number of indicators, some of which can be determined from textual sources (e.g., literary appeal), and some of which typically need non-textual evidence (e.g., curiosity trigger); see Section 2. We give concrete form to Rubin and Liddy (2006) 's indicators and test their impact on blog post retrieval effectiveness. We do not consider all indicators: we only consider indicators that are textual in nature, and to ensure reproducibility of our results, we only consider indicators that can be derived from the TRECBlog06 corpus (and that do not need additional resources such as bloggers' profiles that may be hard to obtain for technical or legal reasons). We detail and implement two groups of credibility indicators: post level (these use information about individual posts) and blog level (these use information from the underlying blogs). Within the post level group, we distinguish between topic dependent and independent indicators. To make matters concrete, consider Figure 1 : both posts are relevant to the query \"tennis,\" but based on obvious surface level features of the posts we quickly determine Post 2 to be more credible than Post 1. The most obvious features are spelling errors, the lack of leading capitals, and the large number of exclamation marks and Post 1 as for today (monday) we had no school! yaay labor day. but we had tennis from 9-11 at the highschool. after that me suzi melis & ashley had a picnic at cecil park and then played tennis. i just got home right now. it was a very very very fun afternoon. (...) we will have a short week. mine will be even shorter b/c i wont be there all day on friday cuz we have the Big 7 Tournament at like keystone oaks or sumthin. so i will miss school the whole day. Post 2 Wimbledon champion Venus Williams has pulled out of next week's Kremlin Cup with a knee injury, tournament organisers said on Friday. The American has not played since pulling out injured of last month's China Open. The former world number one has been troubled by various injuries (...) Williams's withdrawal is the latest blow for organisers after Australian Open champion and home favorite Marat Safin withdrew (...). Figure 1 : Two blog posts relevant to the query \"tennis.\" personal pronouns-i.e., topic independent onesand the fact that the language usage in the second post is more easily associated with credible information about tennis than the language usage in the first post-i.e., a topic dependent feature. Our main finding is that topical blog post retrieval can benefit from using credibility indicators in the retrieval process. Both post and blog level indicator groups each show a significant improvement over the baseline. When we combine all features we obtain the best retrieval performance, and this performance is comparable to the best performing TREC 2006 and 2007 Blog track participants. The improvement over the baseline is stable across most topics, although topic shift occurs in a few cases. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide information on determining credibility; we also relate previous work to the credibility indicators that we consider. Section 3 specifies our retrieval model, a method for incorporating credibility indicators in our retrieval model, and estimations of credibility indicators. Section 4 gives the results of our experiments aimed at assessing the contribution of credibility towards blog post retrieval effectiveness. We conclude in Section 5. Credibility Indicators In our choice of credibility indicators we use (Rubin and Liddy, 2006) 's work as a reference point. We recall the main points of their framework and relate our indicators to it. We briefly discuss other credibility-related indicators found in the literature. 2.1 Rubin and Liddy (2006) 's work Rubin and Liddy (2006) proposed a four factor analytical framework for blog-readers' credibility assessment of blog sites, based in part on evidentiality theory (Chafe, 1986) , website credibility assessment surveys (Stanford et al., 2002) Our credibility indicators We only consider credibility indicators that avoid making use of the searcher's or blogger's identity (i.e., excluding 1a, 1c, 1e, 1f, 2e from Rubin and Liddy's list), that can be estimated automatically from available test collections only so as to facilitate repeatability of our experiments (ruling out 3e, 4a, 4c, 4d, 4e), that are textual in nature (ruling out 2d), and that can be reliably estimated with state-of-theart language technology (ruling out 2a, 2b, 2c, 2g). For reasons that we explain below, we also ignore the \"hyperlinks to others\" indicator (1d). The indicators that we do consider-1b, 2f, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3f, 3g, 4b -are organized in two groups, depending on the information source that we use to estimate them, post level and blog level, and the former is further subdivided into topic independent and topic dependent. Table 1 lists the indicators we consider, together with the corresponding Rubin and Liddy indicator(s). Let us quickly explain our indicators. First, we consider the use of capitalization to be an indicator of good writing style, which in turn contributes to a sense of credibility. Second, we identify Western style emoticons (e.g., :-) and :-D) in blog posts, and assume that excessive use indicates a less credible blog post. Third, words written in all caps are considered shouting in a web environment; we consider shouting to be indicative for non-credible posts. Fourth, a credible author should be able to write without (a lot of) spelling errors; the more spelling errors occur in a blog post, the less credible we consider it to be. Fifth, we assume that credible texts have a reasonable length; the text should supply enough information to convince the reader of the author's credibility. Sixth, assuming that much of what goes on in the blogosphere is inspired by events in the news (Mishne and de Rijke, 2006) , we believe that, for news related topics, a blog post is more credible if it is published around the time of the triggering news event (timeliness). Seventh, our semantic indicator also exploits the news-related nature of many blog posts, and \"prefers\" posts whose language usage is similar to news stories on the topic. Eighth, blogs are a popular place for spammers; spam blogs are not considered credible and we want to demote them in the search results. Ninth, comments are a notable blog feature: readers of a blog post often have the possibility of leaving a comment for other readers or the author. When people comment on a blog post they apparently find the post worth putting effort in, which can be seen as an indicator of credibility (Mishne and Glance, 2006) . Tenth, blogs consist of multiple posts in (reverse) chronological order. The temporal aspect of blogs may indicate credibility: we assume that bloggers with an irregular posting behavior are less credible than bloggers who post regularly. And, finally, we consider the topical fluctuation of a blogger's posts. When looking for credible information we would like to retrieve posts from bloggers that have a certain level of (topical) consistency: not the fluctuating Other work In a web setting, credibility is often couched in terms of authoritativeness and estimated by exploiting the hyperlink structure. Two well-known examples are the PageRank and HITS algorithms (Liu, 2007) , that use the link structure in a topic independent or topic dependent way, respectively. Zhou and Croft (2005) propose collection-document distance and signal-to-noise ratio as priors for the indication of quality in web ad hoc retrieval. The idea of using link structure for improving blog post retrieval has been researched, but results do not show improvements. E.g., Mishne (2007a) finds that retrieval performance decreased. This confirms lessons from the TREC web tracks, where participants found no conclusive benefit from the use of link information for ad hoc retrieval tasks (Hawking and Craswell, 2002) . Hence, we restrict ourselves to the use of content-based features for blog post retrieval, thus ignoring indicator 1d (hyperlinks to others). Related to credibility in blogs is the automatic assessment of forum post quality discussed by Weimer et al. (2007) . The authors use surface, lexical, syntactic and forum-specific features to classify forum posts as bad posts or good posts. The use of forumspecific features (such as whether or not the post contains HTML, and the fraction of characters that are inside quotes of other posts), gives the highest benefits to the classification. Working in the community question/answering domain, Agichtein et al. (2008) use a content features, as well non-content information available, such as links between items and explicit quality ratings from members of the community to identify high-quality content. As we argued above, spam identification may be part of estimating a blog (or blog post's) credibility. Spam identification has been successfully applied in the blogosphere to improve retrieval effectiveness; see, e.g., (Mishne, 2007b; Java et al., 2007) . Modeling In this section we detail the retrieval model that we use, incorporating ranking by relevance and by credibility. We also describe how we estimate the credibility indicators listed in Section 2. Baseline retrieval model We address the baseline retrieval task using a language modeling approach (Croft and Lafferty, 2003) , where we rank documents given a query: p(d|q) = p(d)p(q|d)p(q) \u22121 . Using Bayes' Theorem we rewrite this, ignoring expressions that do not influence the ranking, obtaining p(d|q) \u221d p(d)p(q|d), (1) and, assuming that query terms are independent, p(d|q) \u221d p(d) t\u2208q p(t|\u03b8 d ) n(t,q) , (2) where \u03b8 d is the blog post model, and n(t, q) denotes the number of times term t occurs in query q. To prevent numerical underflows, we perform this computation in the log domain: log p(d|q) \u221d log p(d) + t\u2208q n(t, q) log p(t|\u03b8 d ) (3) In our final formula for ranking posts based on relevance only we substitute n(t, q) by the probability of the term given the query. This allows us to assign different weights to query terms and yields: log p(d|q) \u221d log p(d) + t\u2208q p(t|q) log p(t|\u03b8 d ). (4) For our baseline experiments we assume that all query terms are equally important and set p(t|q) set to be n(t, q) \u2022 |q| \u22121 . The component p(d) is the topic independent (\"prior\") probability that the document is relevant; in the baseline model, priors are ignored. Incorporating credibility Next, we extend Eq. 4 by incorporating estimations of the credibility indicators listed in Table 1 . Recall that our credibility indicators come in two kindspost level and blog level-and that the post level indicators can be topic indepedent or topic dependent, while all blog level indicators are topic independent. Now, modeling topic independent indicators is easy-they can simply be incorporated in Eq. 4 as a weighted sum of two priors: p(d) = \u03bb \u2022 p pl (d) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u2022 p bl (d), (5) where p pl (d) and p bl (d) are the post level and blog level prior probability of d, respectively. The priors p pl and p bl are defined as equally weighted sums: p pl (d) = i 1 5 \u2022 p i (d) p bl (d) = j 1 4 \u2022 p j (d), where i \u2208 {capitalization, emoticons, shouting, spelling, post length} and j \u2208 {spam, comments, regularity, consistency}. Estimations of the priors p i and p j are given below; the weighting parameter \u03bb is determined experimentally. Modeling topic dependent indicators is slighty more involved. Given a query q, we create a query model \u03b8 q that is a mixture of a temporal query model \u03b8 temporal and a semantic query model \u03b8 semantic : p(t|\u03b8 q ) = (6) \u00b5 \u2022 p(t|\u03b8 temporal ) + (1 \u2212 \u00b5) \u2022 p(t|\u03b8 semantic ). The component models \u03b8 temporal and \u03b8 semantic will be estimated below; the parameter \u00b5 will be estimated experimentally. Our final ranking formula, then, is obtained by plugging in Eq. 5 and 6 in Eq. 4: log p(d|q) \u221d log p(d) + \u03b2 ( t p(t|q) \u2022 log p(t|\u03b8 d )) (7) + (1 \u2212 \u03b2) ( t p(t|\u03b8 q ) \u2022 log p(t|\u03b8 d )) . Estimating credibility indicators Next, we specify how each of the credibility indicators is estimated; we do so in two groups: post level and blog level. Post level credibility indicators Capitalization We estimate the capitalization prior as follows: p capitalization (d) = n(c, s) \u2022 |s| \u22121 , (8) where n(c, s) is the number of sentences starting with a capital and |s| is the number of sentences; we only consider sentences with five or more words. Emoticons The emoticons prior is estimated as p emoticons (d) = 1 \u2212 n(e, d) \u2022 |d| \u22121 , (9) where n(e, d) is the number of emoticons in the post and |d| is the length of the post in words. Shouting We use the following equation to estimate the shouting prior: p shouting (d) = 1 \u2212 n(a, d) \u2022 |d| \u22121 , (10) where n(a, d) is the number of all caps words in blog post d and |d| is the post length in words. Spelling The spelling prior is estimated as p spelling (d) = 1 \u2212 n(m, d) \u2022 |d| \u22121 , (11) where n(m, d) is the number of misspelled (or unknown) words and |d| is the post length in words. Post length The post length prior is estimated using |d|, the post length in words: p length (d) = log(|d|). (12) Timeliness We estimate timeliness using the timebased language models \u03b8 temporal proposed in (Li and Croft, 2003; Mishne, 2007b) . I.e., we use a news corpus from the same period as the blog corpus that we use for evaluation purposes (see Section 4.2). We assign a timeliness score per post based on: p(d|\u03b8 temporal ) = k \u22121 \u2022 (n(date(d), k) + 1) , ( 13 ) where k is the number of top results from the initial result list, date(d) is the date associated with document d, and n(date(d), k) is the number of documents in k with the same date as d. For our initial result list we perform retrieval on both the blog and the news corpus and take k = 50 for both corpora. Semantic A semantic query model \u03b8 semantic is obtained using ideas due to Diaz and Metzler (2006) . Again, we use a news corpus from the same period as the evaluation blog corpus and estimate \u03b8 semantic . We issue the query to the external news corpus, retrieve the top 10 documents and extract the top 10 distinctive terms from these documents. These terms are added to the original query terms to capture the language usage around the topic. Blog level credibility indicators Spam filtering To estimate the spaminess of a blog, we take a simple approach. We train an SVM classifier on a labeled splog blog dataset (Kolari et al., 2006) using the top 1500 words for both spam and non-spam blogs as features. For each classified blog d we have a confidence value s(d). If the classifier cannot make a decision (s(d) = 0) we set p spam (d) to 0, otherwise we use the following to transform s(d) into a spam prior p spam (d): p spam (d) = s(d) 2|s(d)| + \u22121 \u2022 s(d) 2s(d) 2 + 2|s(d)| + 1 2 . ( 14 ) Comments We estimate the comment prior as p comment (d) = log(n(r, d)), (15) where n(r, d) is the number of comments on post d. Regularity To estimate the regularity prior we use p regularity (d) = log(\u03c3 interval ), (16) where \u03c3 interval expresses the standard deviation of the temporal intervals between two successive posts. Topical consistency Here we use an approach similar to query clarity (Cronen-Townsend and Croft, 2002) : based on the list of posts from the same blog we compare the topic distribution of blog B to the topic distribution in the collection C and assign a 'clarity' value to B; a score further away from zero indicates a higher topical consistency. We estimate the topical consistency prior as p topic (d) = log(clarity(d)), (17 Efficiency All estimators discussed above can be implemented efficiently: most are document priors and can therefore be calculated offline. The only topic dependent estimators are timeliness and language usage; both can be implemented efficiently as specific forms of query expansion. Evaluation In this section we describe the experiments we conducted to answer our research questions about the impact of credibility on blog post retrieval. Research questions Our research revolves around the contribution of credibility to the effectiveness of topical blog post retrieval: what is the contribution of individual indicators, of the post level indicators (topic dependent or independent), of the blog level indicators, and of all indicators combined? And do different topics benefit from different indicators? To answer our research question we compared the performance of the baseline retrieval system (as detailed in Section 3.1) with extensions of the baseline system with a single indicator, a set of indicators, or all indicators. Setup We apply our models to the TREC Blog06 corpus (Macdonald and Ounis, 2006) . This corpus has been constructed by monitoring around 100,000 blog feeds for a period of 11 weeks in early 2006, downloading all posts created in this period. For each permalink (HTML page containing one blog post) the feed id is registered. We can use this id to aggregate post level features to the blog level. In our experiments we use only the HTML documents, 3.2M permalinks, which add up to around 88 GB. The TREC 2006 and 2007 Blog tracks each offer 50 topics and assessments (Ounis et al., 2007; Macdonald et al., 2007) . For topical relevancy, assessment was done using a standard two-level scale: the content of the post was judged to be topically relevant or not. The evaluation metrics that we use are standard ones: mean average precision (MAP) and precision@10 (p@10) (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). For all our retrieval tasks we use the title field (T) of the topic statement as query. To estimate the timeliness and semantic credibility indicators, we use AQUAINT-2, a set of newswire articles (2.5 GB, about 907K documents) that are roughly contemporaneous with the TREC Blog06 collection (AQUAINT-2, 2007) . Articles are in English and come from a variety of sources. Statistical significance is tested using a two-tailed paired t-test. Significant improvements over the baseline are marked with (\u03b1 = 0.05) or (\u03b1 = 0.01). We use and for a drop in performance (for \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b1 = 0.01, respectively). Parameter estimation The models proposed in Section 3.2 contain parameters \u03b2, \u03bb and \u00b5. These parameters need to be estimated and, hence, require a training and test set. We use a two-fold parameter estimation process: in the first cycle we estimate the parameters on the TREC 2006 Blog topic set and test these settings on the topics of the TREC 2007 Blog track. The second cycle goes the other way around and trains on the 2007 set, while testing on the 2006 set. Figure 2 shows the optimum values for \u03bb, \u03b2, and \u00b5 on the 2006 and the 2007 topic sets for both MAP (bottom lines) and p@10 (top lines). When looking at the MAP scores, the optimal setting for \u03bb is almost identical for the two topic sets: 0.4 for the 2006 set and 0.3 for the 2007 set, and also the optimal setting for \u03b2 is very similar for both sets: 0.4 for the 2006 set and 0.5 for the 2007 set. As to \u00b5, it is clear that timeliness does not improve the performance over using the semantic feature alone and the optimal setting for \u00b5 is therefore 0.0. Both \u00b5 and \u03b2 show similar behavior on p@10 as on MAP, but for \u03bb we see a different trend. If early precision is required, the value of \u03bb should be increased, giving more weight to the topic-independent post level features compared to the blog level features. Retrieval performance Table 2 lists the retrieval results for the baseline, for each of the credibility indicators (on top of the baseline), for four subsets of indicators, and for all indicators combined. The baseline performs similar to the median scores at the TREC 2006 Blog track (MAP: 0.2203; p@10: 0.564) and somewhat below the median MAP score at 2007 Blog track (MAP: 0.3340) but above the median p@10 score: 0.3805. 2 : Retrieval performance on 2006 and 2007 topics, using \u03bb = 0.3, \u03b2 = 0.4, and \u00b5 = 0.0. Some (topic independent) post level indicators hurt the MAP score, while others help (for both years, and both measures). Combined, the topic independent post level indicators perform less well than the use of one of them (post length). As to the topic dependent post level indicators, timeliness hurts performance on MAP for both years, while the semantic indicator provides significant improvements across the board (resulting in a top 2 score in terms of MAP and a top 5 score in terms of p@10, when compared to the TREC 2006 Blog track participants that only used the T field). Some of the blog level features hurt more than they help (regularity, consistency), while the comments feature helps, on all measures, and for both years. Combined, the blog level features help less than the use of one of them (comments). As a group, the combined post level features help more than either of the two post level sub groups alone. The blog level features show similar results to the topic-independent post level features, obtaining a significant increase on both MAP and p@10, but lower than the topic-dependent post level features. The grand combination of all credibility indicators leads to a significant improvement over any of the single indicators and over any of the four subsets considered in Table 2 . The MAP score of this run is higher than the best performing run in the TREC 2006 Blog track and has a top 3 performance on p@10; its 2007 performance is just within the top half on both MAP and p@10. Analysis Next we examine the differences in average precision (per topic) between the baseline and subsets of indicators (post and blog level) and the grand combination. We limit ourselves to an analysis of the MAP scores. Figure 3 displays the per topic average precision scores, where topics are sorted by absolute gain of the grand combination over the baseline. In 2006, 7 (out of 50) topics were negatively affected by the use of credibility indicators; in 2007, 15 (out of 50) were negatively affected. Table 3 lists the topics that displayed extreme behavior (in terms of relative performance gain or drop in AP score). While the extreme drops for both years are in the same range, the gains for 2006 are more extreme than for 2007. The topic that is hurt most (in absolute terms) by the credibility indicators is the 2007 topic 910: aperto network (AP -0.2781). The semantic indicator is to blame for this decrease is: the terms included in the expanded query shift the topic from a wireless broadband provider to television networks.  for the post level indicators get a performance drop in AP for 28 topics (10 plus 18, respectively) and for the blog level indicators we get a drop for 15 topics (4 plus 11, respectively). Hence, the combination of all indicators strikes a good balance between overall performance gain and per topic risk. Conclusions We provided efficient estimations for 11 credibility indicators and assessed their impact on topical blog post retrieval, on top of a content-based retrieval baseline. We compared the contribution of these indicators, both individually and in groups, and found that (combined) they have a significant positive impact on topical blog post retrieval effectiveness. Certain single indicators, like post length and comments, make good credibility indicators on their own; the best performing credibility indicator group consists of topic dependent post level ones. Other future work concerns indicator selection: instead of taking all indicators on board, consider selected indicators only, in a topic dependent fashion. Our choice of credibility indicators was based on a framework proposed by Rubin and Liddy (2006) : the estimators we used are natural implementations of the selected indicators, but by no means the only possible ones. In future work we intend to extend the set of indicators considered so as to include, e.g., stated competencies (1e), by harvesting and analyzing bloggers' profiles, and to extend the set of estimators for indicators that we already consider such as reading level measures (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) for the literary appeal indicator (4b).
