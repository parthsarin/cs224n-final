The dictionary is considered in this framework as a prima~'y source of basic general knowledge. In the paper we describe a project to develop a system which has word-sense acquisition fi'om information contained in computerized dictionaries and knowledge organization as its main objectives. The approach consists in a discovery procedure technique operating on natural language delinitions, which is recursively applied and relined. We start [i'om free-text definitions, in natural language linear form, analyzing and converting them into infbrmationally equivalent structured forms. This new approach, which aims at reorganizing ti'ee text into elaborately structured information, could be called the Lcxical Knowledge Base (I.KB) approach. Baekgromld For a cmlsidcrable period in theoretical and computational linguistics, there was a predominant lack of interest in lexical problems, which were regarded as being of minor importance with respect to \"core\" issues concerning linguistic phenomena, mainly of a syntactic nature, l)uring the last few years, howevcr, this trend has been ahnost reversed. The role of the lexicon in both linguistic thcories and computational applications is now being greatly revalued and one aspect on which a number of research groups are now focussing their attention is the possibility of reusing the large quantity of data contained in alrcady existing machine-readable lcxical sources, mainly dictionaries prepared for photocomposition, as a short cut in the construction of extensive NLl'-oriented lexicons. This position was formulated very clearly in a number of papers presented at a recent workshop organized in Grosseto (Italy) and sponsored by the European Community (see Walker, Zampolli, Calzolari, furthcoming) , and can be found in the set el\" recommendations which was one of\" the results of this workshop (Zampolli 1987, pp.332-335) . After the first work on machine-readable dictiona,'ies (MRI)s) in the seventies (see Olney 1972 , Sherman 1974) , and with the recent development oI~the concept of'a lexical database (l.l)B) in which interaction, flexibility and multidiinensionality can be achieved, but everything must be explicitly stated in advance (see e.g. Amsler 1980 , Byrd 1983 , Calzolari 1982 , Michiels 1980) , a new possibility which is now emerging is that o1\" a procedural exploitation of the lull range of semantic intbrmation implicitly contained in MRI)s (see Wilks 1987 , Binot 1987 , Alshawi forthcoming, Calzolari forthcoming). [he dictionary is now considered as a prilnary source not only of lcxical knowledge but also of basic general knowledge (ranging over the entire \"world\"), and some of tim dictionary systems which are being developed have knowled~,e acquisition and knowledge organization as their principal objectives (see also l.enat al/d [:eigenbaum 1987) . In this paper we describe at project which we are now conducting on the acquisition of semantic inlbrmation ti'om computerized dictionaries. to those used by other groups (see Chodorow 1985 , Calzolari 1983 , Amslcr 1981) . We have now begun work on restructuring another dictionary available in MRF, the Garzanti Italian dictionary (1984). A parser has been implemented which, on the basis of the typesetting codes for photocomposition, identifies the rough structure of each lexical entry. Fig. 1 displays the output of a parsed entry of the Garzanti dictionary. Fig. 2 represents the provisional model for a monolingual lexical entry as we have defined it so far. Fig. 3 gives the projection of the first interpretation of the typesetting codes into this model; other kinds of information will be added afterwards (for example, that obtained by the inductive procedures described in the paper).  88 The merging of part of the data of tile DM I and the Garzanti dictionary into a single LI)B has already been completed, e.g. for lemmas, POSs, usage codes, etc. We now have to tackle the problcm of reorganizing the semantic data (dcfinitions and examples). Itcre our strategy is to design a new procedural system which is ablc to gradually \"learn\" and acquire semantic infornlation from dictionary definitions, going well bcyond thc IS-A hierarchies constructed so far, in order to attempt to also capturc what is prescnt in the \"diffcrcntia\" part of the definition. This can be achieved with some success given the particular nature of lexicographic definitions, with: a) a generic (and pe'rhaps over simplistic) description of the \"world\"; b) a rather lcxically and syntactically constrained and a somewhat regular natural language tcxt (Calzolari 1984 , Wilks 1987) . After having mappcd the codcs for photocomposition into linguistically relevant codes, all the preliminarily parsed data of the Garzanti have been organized on a PC in the form of a Textual Database (DBrl'), a fuEl-text Information Retrieval (IR) system in which all occurrences of any word-form or lermna can be directly accessed (Picchi 1983 ). The I)BT has been found to be a very powerful tool in evidencing lexical units and particular syntagms which can then be exploited in our \"patternmatching\" procedure. With the text in DBT form it is possible to search occurrences of single word-forms in definitions and examples, lemmas, codes of various types (POS, specialized languages, usage labels, etc.), and also cooccurrences of any of these items throughout the entire dictionary. In addition, structures composed of combinations of the above elements connected by the logical operators \"and\" and \"or\" to any degree of complexity can also be searched. The results of such queries are returned together with the pertinent dictionary entries. Obviously frequencies can also be obtained. All this information can be retrieved with Fast interactive access. We have therefore already implemented two types of organization for dictionary data: 1) DB-type organization with the DM1 (we have not used a standard DBMS, but an ad hoc designed relational 1)B system); 2) a full-text IR system for the Garzanti dictionary. Although both types of organization have proved to be very powerful tools for different scopes, at tile same time each presents certain drawbacks and difficulties, due to the particular nature of dictionary data which in neither case has it been possible to fully exploit. Dictionary data is in fact of a very particular nature, consisting of a combination of free text in a highly organized structure. The DB approach copes well with the second characteristic, while the [R approach is successful in handling free text. tlowever neither is capable of fully exploiting the two features in combination. A new method must be envisaged, capable of reorganizing free text into elaborately structured information: this could be called the Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) approach, and is the aim of the project described here. Fig. 5 shows the result of applying this disambiguation procedure to all the homographs shown in the preceding example. We then had to implement a set of discovery procedures acting on dictionary definitions. Entry ( EDITORE ) Def ( che o chi stampa e pubblica libri, periodici o musica, a scopo commereiale) F ( che ) L (che, ['PR' ,['NN'] ], ['PT' ,['NS'] ], ['DT' ,['NN'] ], ['DE' ,['NN'] ], ['PI' ,['MS'] ], ['C ' ,[' '2 ] ) F(o) L (o, ['SN' ,['NS'] ], ['C ' ,[' '] ], ['I ' ,[' '] ] ) F ( chl ) L (chi, ['PR' ,['NS'] ] ) F ( stampa ) L [stampa, ['SF' ,['FS'] ] ) L ( Entry ( EDITORE ) Def I che o chi stampa e pubblica libri, periodici musica, a scopo commerciale}  This is, therefore, ou.r approach. We begin with a system which has simple and general pnrpose pattern-matching capabilities, designing it as an incremental system. To cope with the fact that there are ~ariations in the way the same conceptual category or the same relation is linguistically (lcxically aider syntactically) rendered in natural language definitions, each sttcll category or relation is associated with a list of specilicd lcxical units and or syntactic t'caturcs which give the variant Ibrms. The search is then driven by these lists of patterns to handle the grammatical and lexical variations. F che) L (che, ['PR' ,['NN'] ] ) F o) L (o, ['C ' ,[' '] ] ) F chi ) L (chi, ['PR' ,['NS'] ] ) F stampa ) L (stampare, ['VTP' ,['S31P'] ] ) E e) L (e, ['CC' ,[' '] ] ) F pubbl ica ) L (pubblicare, ['VT' ,['S31P'] ] ) F libri ) L [fibre, ['SW ,['MP'] ] ) P , ) F The \"pattcn>nmtching\" strategy has bccn obviously integrated with the Italian morphological analyzer to handle inflectional variation. The patterns may contain either l.abcls, or Lemmas, or Word-tbrms. For the Labels, the system searches for all the associated lcmmas and all their word-fornas (unless otherwise spccificd); in the same way l.emmas are automatically expanded to cover their inllccted word-fo,'ms, Generally, wc look for recurring patterns in the definitions and attempt to associate them with corresponding relations or conceptual categories. Fig. 6 lists some of the entries and delinitimts obtained when querying the dictionary in t)BT form for cooccurrcnces of items such as 'science, discipline, branch,...' together with 'studies, concerns, \" Analyzing the results of similar queries to the dictionary we are able to better identify a number of patterns to be used in the semantic scanning of the definitions.  where the tbllowing are the lemmas associated to the Labels: SCII;NCE = (scienza, disciplina, specialita', branca, ramo, parte) STUDY = (studia, si occupa di). NILOi3.1 is the subje(St matter of the science. The results of a first run through the whole dictionary using an initial set of patterns can afterwards be recursively revised when new data are acquired. Our practical global research strategy is to develop a system which at the beginning has only a generalized expertise. This system obviously breaks down at many points on its first rtm; we can then evaluate all these 90 points, and consider when and where measures must be taken to overcome specilic difficulties. In this way, ncw capabilities can be added incrementally to the system so that gradually it is able to cope with increasingly difficult data. Thus wc systematically add new \"knowledge\" to the system, prompted each time by a failure to cope with the given data. It seems to us that this is a practical research strategy For cliciting and modelling vague and fuzzy knowledge. liven though the methodological approach has been deliberately simplified at the beginning (in order to introduce problems gradually, a few at a time), the dimensions of the data have not bccn limited in any way. 4. The knowledge organization. Although the body of knowledge with which we are dealing is at least partly based on intuition, on vague and not even coherent data (as lexicographic definitions often are), and on inductive empirical strategies, we must attempt to model the knowledge as the system acquires it. The formalism for the representation of word-senses is as follows. Each element is defined as a Function characterized by a As the metalanguage and the rules are declared separately from the pattern-matching parser, the system is incremental, flexible, portable (it can be used with other languages or other dictionaries), and testable. In fact, the system has been designed so that it is easy to test alternative strategies or sets of rules or constraints. This kind of organization will allow us to draw inferences, using part of the formal structure associated to an entry and inserting it in other structures in which that entry appears as an Argument. For example, 'microbiologia' present in tile second definition above is dclined in its turn as 'parle della biologia the studia i microrganismi...', translated as The analysis in SOmE cases is thercfbrc t',urposcly delayed until more relevant information has been acquired, and wi]l eventually be based on the results of dclinitions already successl'ully handled. This analysis o[\" the litst resuhs will lead to an improven~ent of the system, adding other patterns or other surface realizations of already existing patterns to the lirst simple list of t)atterns, and also imposing constraints on given hypernyms or on given relations. I'heretbre, after the first stage, the system consists of patterns augmented with conditioning rules which will then drive subsequent runnings of tile procedure ([br those cases which are lexically or grammatically conditioned). In this way, the system can be gradually retined. The analysis procedure is envisaged as a series of cycles which lind relevant cooccurrenccs of categories and relations that can then be set as conditioning rules to further guide successive searches. Art interactive phase is also foreseen so that, when necessary, definitions can be modified [br a normalization in accordance to acceptable analysis structures. From succes!ive passes through the data, applying different and increasingly <efined sets of patterns and rules, the procedure huilds up, as completely as possible with this methodology, a formal description of the structure of the lexical definitions. At the end, from a comparison of the different formalized stuctures generated, we will be able to associate structures which differ for only one element (a conceptual category or relation). In this way, we can construct something like \"minimal pairs\" of sense-definitions, which only differ in one conceptual or relational feature. It can be reasonably supposed that this teature is related or realizes one of the differences between these words. It will also be possible to build hierarchies not only for hypcrnyms, but also, and more interestingly, for complex conceptual structures considered as a whole.",
