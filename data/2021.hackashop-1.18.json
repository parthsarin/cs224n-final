    "article": "Today, news media organizations regularly engage with readers by enabling them to comment on news articles. This creates the need for comment moderation and removal of disallowed comments -a time-consuming task often performed by human moderators. In this paper we approach the problem of automatic news comment moderation as classification of comments into blocked and not blocked categories. We construct a novel dataset of annotated English comments, experiment with cross-lingual transfer of comment labels and evaluate several machine learning models on datasets of Croatian and Estonian news comments. Introduction Comment sections are an important part of news sites, providing an opportunity for newsrooms to engage with their audience. Comment moderation aims to safeguard respectful conversation by blocking comments that are uncivil, disruptive or potentially unlawful. This is a complex task that balances legal implications and editorial guidelines. Common categories of blocked comments include: unsafe or illegal content (ex. defamation or hate speech), disruptive content (ex. trolling), advertisements, and copyrighted content (Risch and Krestel, 2018) . While newsrooms are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits provided by artificial intelligence and expect comment moderation to become more manageable, implementation of AI solutions is far from prevalent (Society of Editors, 2018; Beckett, 2019) . Some newsrooms use custom automated comment moderation solutions developed inhouse or third-party plugins to complement human moderation. Others rely on external companies that provide comment moderation performed by teams of contracted moderators (Society of Editors, 2018; Beckett, 2019; Woodman, 2013) . For most in-house and third-party solutions, the extent of use and details of the machine learning solutions are not publicly revealed. The stand-out third-party option is Perspective, 1 a free API developed by Google's Jigsaw, available in seven highresourced languages (Beckett, 2019) . To the best of our knowledge, there are no machine learning solutions suitable for comment moderation for underresourced languages. In the academic literature, the problem of comment moderation is commonly approached as a binary classification of comments into blocked and not blocked categories (Pavlopoulos et al., 2017; Risch and Krestel, 2018; Shekhar et al., 2020) . In this paper, which reports the work done during the EMBEDDIA Hackashop hackathon 2 (Pollak et al., 2021) , we approach the problem in the same manner and perform experiments with comment classification on datasets of Croatian and Estonian news comments (Shekhar et al., 2020) . Motivated by the lack of an English dataset of comments labelled as either blocked or not blocked, we construct such a dataset from existing datasets of news and social media comments. We then experiment with the cross-lingual transfer of English labels to Croatian and Estonian comment datasets by means of a multilingual BERT model (Pires et al., 2019; Ulcar and Robnik-Sikonja, 2020) . Finally, we construct and evaluate several classification models trained on Croatian and Estonian datasets, analyze the results, and discuss the problem of automatic detection of blocked comments. We make the source code of the experiments freely available. 3 Related Work Computational comment moderation includes tasks such as offensive language detection (Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017) and blocked comment detection (Risch and Krestel, 2018; Pavlopoulos et al., 2017; Napoles et al., 2017) , which is the focus of our study. Most of the prior studies on comment filtering tackle the problem using text from highresourced languages such as English (Napoles et al., 2017; Kolhatkar et al., 2019) and German (Risch and Krestel, 2018) . There are only a few studies that focus on low-resourced languages (Shekhar et al., 2020; Pavlopoulos et al., 2017) . The methods for comment filtering vary from classical machine learning methods to deep learning approaches. Risch and Krestel (2018) classify comments with a logistic regression classifier using features computed from comments, news articles, and users. Deep neural networks such as RNN and CNN have also been applied (Pavlopoulos et al., 2017) . Most recently, Shekhar et al. (2020) leverage Multilingual BERT (mBERT) (Devlin et al., 2019) for the moderation of news comments in Balto-Slavic languages. English Dataset for Comment Moderation There are multiple publicly available datasets in English with annotated comments that have been used in previous research about comment moderation. However, most of these datasets contain annotations of only a subset of the categories of blocked comments (Shekhar et al., 2020) . We construct a large corpus of comments containing different categories of blocked comments by unifying different datasets and defining a new label. Since comments in these datasets are not explicitly labeled as blocked, we created the flagged and not flagged labels instead. The idea is to identify comments that moderators should review and decide whether to block them or not. The flagged label therefore serves as an approximation of the blocking decision and classifiers that detect it automatically have the potential to save time and human effort. Construction of the Dataset We used five different datasets containing annotated comments from news articles, social media, and other fora. We included comments from platforms outside of news media since users are subject to a similar set of rules related to what content they can share. 4, 5, 6 Each dataset contains different annotations, including comments rated on a scale of toxicity, comments labelled for hateful speech and abuse, comments labeled for constructiveness and tone, etc. Our challenge was to define the labelling criteria for the binary labels flagged and not flagged and consistently apply them to the labels in the five datasets. Flagged comments are the comments most likely to require blocking based on the existing labels in the datasets, and are labeled according to the principles discussed in (Risch and Krestel, 2018) and guidelines for comment moderation in (Society of Editors, 2018) and (Woodman, 2013) . Our dataset consists of comments from the SOCC corpus (SFU Opinion and Comments Corpus) (Kolhatkar et al., 2019) , YNACC corpus (The Yahoo News Annotated Comments Corpus) (Napoles et al., 2017) , DETOX corpus (Wulczyn et al., 2017) , Trawling corpus (Hitkul et al., 2020) , and HASOC corpus (Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages) (Mandl et al., 2019) . SOCC contains annotated comments from opinion articles. We used the constructiveness and toxicity labels and flagged comments whenever the toxicity level was toxic or very toxic and not constructive. YNACC contains expert annotated comments in online news articles. A comment was labeled flagged whenever a comment was insulting, off-topic, controversial or mean and not constructive. DETOX has comments from English Wikipedia talk pages. It contains annotations for attack, aggression and toxicity. A comment was labelled flagged whenever it was toxic, aggressive or if it contained an attack. We only included data from 2015. 1 gives more details on the class distribution and Table 2 contains examples of comments from each dataset that have been labelled as flagged. The dataset can be easily reconstructed by using the code we make available and applying it to the individual sub-datasets which are freely available. Classification Experiments We run a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of classifiers on our dataset. We split our data into train, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to account for class imbalance. In our first experiment, we trained a Logistic regression classifier and Support vector machine classifier with linear kernel. We later fine-tuned two different multilingual BERT models: CroSloEnBERT and FinEstEnBERT (Ulcar and Robnik-Sikonja, 2020) . See Section 4.2 for more details about how the models were optimized and fine-tuned. The results of the classification experiments are in Table 3 . All trained models perform better than the baseline classifier that always chooses the minority class flagged. The non-neural classifiers have higher recall whilst the multilingual BERT models have higher F 1 score, accuracy, and precision. The classification results support the claim that the constructed flagged label is well-defined and consistent and that our dataset can be further used in research related to comment moderation. Automatic Comment Moderation Experiments Next, we construct and evaluate classifiers that aim to detect blocked news comments. We experiment with EMBEDDIA multilingual BERT models (Ulcar and Robnik-Sikonja, 2020) fine-tuned for classification and with standard non-neural classifiers using n-gram features. News Comment Datasets We use the Ekspress dataset of Estonian news comments and the 24Sata dataset of Croatian news comments (Shekhar et al., 2020) . Following Shekhar et al. (2020) we focus on the comments from 2019 that have labels of higher quality. The Estonian comments are simply labelled as either blocked or not blocked, while the blocked Croatian comments are further divided into eight subcategories. We remove the subcategories 2, 4 and 7 that contain either a negligible amount of comments or non-Croatian comments. We also remove all the non-Estonian comments from the Ekspress dataset. After cleaning, 816,131 Croatian and 865,022 Estonian comments remain. Both datasets are unbalanced -only 7.77% of Croatian and 8.99% of Estonian comments are labeled as blocked. Classification Experiments We solve the problem of binary classification of comments into blocked and not blocked categories. We train and evaluate the comment classifiers using First we experiment with the two multilingual BERT models CroSloEnBERT and FinEstEnBERT (Ulcar and Robnik-Sikonja, 2020) , fine-tuned for classification. We rely on the Huggingface library (Wolf et al., 2020) and use the tokenizers embedded in the BERT models, limiting the number of tokens to 128. For each dataset, we build three fine-tuned BERT models. The first model, labeled BERT-en and also evaluated in Section 3.2, is fine-tuned only on English comments. The second model, labeled BERT-nat, is fine-tuned only on the target (native) language (Croatian or Estonian). The third model is produced by fine-tuning the English model on the dataset in the target language, and labeled as BERT-en-nat. We train the models by setting the batch size to 16 and number of epochs to 3, and perform optimization using Adam with weight decay (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) . We select the models that exhibit the best accuracy in the training phase. The second classification approach is based on two standard non-neural classifiers -Logistic regression and Support vector machine with linear kernel. Both classifiers are available as part of the scikit-learn 7 framework Buitinck et al. (2013) . To perform model selection we vary both the regularization strength and the method of feature construction. We find the optimal model parameters by performing a grid search on separate train and test sets containing 40,000 and 10,000 comments. Two optimization criteria are used: F 1 score and recall. The search for a model with high recall is motivated by the observation that the majority of the models tend to favor high precision. We find that the Logistic regression offers better performance across both datasets, and that the best choice of features is the binary bag-of-words-and-bigrams vector. 7 https://scikit-learn.org The classification results are displayed in Table 4 . The performance scores are modest in terms of F 1 and show sharp precision/recall tradeoffs. All of the models outperform the baseline classifier that always chooses the minority class. Accuracy scores are deceptively high due to the prevalence of the non-blocked comments in the datasets. BERT classifiers perform better on Croatian than on Estonian comments, possibly because of differences in the original multilingual BERT models. BERT models fine-tuned only on the English dataset of flagged comments have weak but above-baseline performance, which shows that a certain amount of cross-language knowledge transfer is achieved. The weak performance could be explained both by the language difference and the fact that the English dataset represents an approximation of the blocked comments class. Shekhar et al. (2020) classify comments from the same datasets, train the models on data containing an equal share of blocked and not blocked comments, and report recall of 0.67, precision of 0.27, and F 1 of 0.38 for the Croatian comments. This result is in line with the sharp precision/recall tradeoffs we observe. Balanced training data in (Shekhar et al., 2020 ) is a possible reason for higher recall scores obtained (0.70 on the Croatian and 0.58 for the Estonian dataset). Lastly, we examine the classifiers' performance on sub-categories of blocked Croatian comments detailed in (Shekhar et al., 2020) . Table 5 contains recall scores achieved by the BERT-en model trained on the English dataset, BERT-native model trained on the Croatian dataset, the Logistic regression model, and the mBERT model of Shekhar et al. (2020) that is also trained on the Croatian dataset. The performances of the Logistic regression model and the mBERT model demonstrate the benefit of optimizing for recall. The BERT-en model achieves competitive results on the \"Vulgarity\" and \"Abuse\" categories, showing that detection of these types of blocked comments was successfully transferred from the English dataset. Better results on other categories could be achieved by augmenting the English dataset with additional flagged comments containing deception and misinformation, as well as the spam and copyright infringement content pertaining to the \"Disallowed\" category. Discussion Automatic detection of blocked comments of the Croatian and the Estonian dataset is a hard problem. This claim is supported by modest F 1 scores and sharp precision/recall tradeoffs observed both in our experiments and in the experiments of Shekhar et al. (2020) . While inclusion of non-textual comment features would probably lead to better results (Risch and Krestel, 2018) , we hypothesize that the main problem is the poor quality of comment labelling. The definition of sensible text categories and consistent annotation of texts with these categories falls within the domain of content analysis (Krippendorff, 2012) . Ideally, the category definitions are discussed and fine-tuned, and the measure of inter-annotator agreement (IAA) is reported. In the case of the blocked comment detection, the precise process of category definition is unknown (Pavlopoulos et al., 2017; Risch and Krestel, 2018; Shekhar et al., 2020) , while the IAA is either not available (Risch and Krestel, 2018; Shekhar et al., 2020) , or modest (Pavlopoulos et al., 2017) . Moreover, there are indications of inconsistencies in the definition of a blocked comment class. Shekhar et al. (2020) report that the varying blocking rates are probably caused by changes in moderation policy. Pavlopoulos et al. (2017) and Risch and Krestel (2018) report that a high influx of user comments, for example during high-interest events, causes more strict comment blocking. The mentioned problems should be tackled since the consistent labelling of the comments is key to building highquality classifiers. The binary classification approach might be in disconnect with the true needs of the comment moderators. An engineering perspective of a machine learning system can significantly differ from the end user's perspective (Lee et al., 2017) . We believe that studies including comment moderators are essential in order to define and evaluate the appropriate solution. For example, the amount of moderators' time saved might prove as a useful metric, and the best application of classifiers might not be automatic blocking but flagging and pre-filtering of comments. Additionally, moderators operate within boundaries set by in-house rules and practices and legal regulations. An investigation of the nature and impact of such restrictions would provide perspective on the role of automatic comment moderation. For example, in a scenario where the publisher can be held accountable for the comments containing hate speech, any automatic classifier would be required to achieve very high recall. Conclusion and Future Work We plan to further develop the dataset of flagged English comments, experiment with other classification models and to improve the BERT-based language transfer models. We also plan to examine multi-task learning approaches that can lead to state-of-art results on transferring knowledge among related tasks (Zhang and Yang, 2017) . We believe that more attention should be paid to the problem of comment labelling. This could lead to better classifiers, reliable inter-annotator agreement scores that can serve as upper bounds on performance, and to a better understanding of the semantics of the composite category of blocked comments. In our view, an essential future work direction is design and implementation of studies with comment moderators that examine real-world scenarios and user needs. We believe that such studies would be invaluable and would lead to more realistic and usable machine learning comment moderation tools.",
