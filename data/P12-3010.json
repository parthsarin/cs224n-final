Given a multi-word expression as a query, the system involves retrieving sentence pairs from a bilingual corpus, identifying translation equivalents of the query in the sentence pairs (translation spotting) and ranking the retrieved sentence pairs according to the relevance between the query and the translation equivalents. To provide high-precision translation spotting for domain-specific translation tasks, we exploited a normalized correlation method to spot the translation equivalents. To ranking the retrieved sentence pairs, we propose a correlation function modified from the Dice coefficient for assessing the correlation between the query and the translation equivalents. The performances of the translation spotting module and the ranking module are evaluated in terms of precision-recall measures and coverage rate respectively. Introduction A bilingual concordancer is a tool that can retrieve aligned sentence pairs in a parallel corpus whose source sentences contain the query and the translation equivalents of the query are identified in the target sentences. It helps not only on finding translation equivalents of the query but also presenting various contexts of occurrence. As a result, it is extremely useful for bilingual lexicographers, human translators and second language learners (Bowker and Barlow 2004; Bourdaillet et al., 2010; Gao 2011) . Identifying the translation equivalents, translation spotting, is the most challenging part of a bilingual concordancer. Recently, most of the existing bilingual concordancers spot translation equivalents in terms of word alignment-based method. (Jian et al., 2004; Callison-Burch et al., 2005; Bourdaillet et al., 2010) . However, word alignment-based translation spotting has some drawbacks. First, aligning a rare (low frequency) term may encounter the garbage collection effect (Moore, 2004; Liang et al., 2006) that cause the term to align to many unrelated words. Second, the statistical word alignment model is not good at many-to-many alignment due to the fact that translation equivalents are not always correlated in lexical level. Unfortunately, the above effects will be intensified in a domain-specific concordancer because the queries are usually domain-specific terms, which are mostly multi-word low-frequency terms and semantically non-compositional terms. Wu et al. (2003) employed a statistical association criterion to spot translation equivalents in their bilingual concordancer. The associationbased criterion can avoid the above mentioned effects. However, it has other drawbacks in translation spotting task. First, it will encounter the contextual effect that causes the system incorrectly spot the translations of the strongly collocated context. Second, the association-based translation spotting tends to spot the common subsequence of a set of similar translations instead of the full translations. Figure 1 illustrates an example of contextual effect, in which 'Fan K'uan' is incorrectly spotted as part of the translation of the query term ' \u8c3f \u5c71 \u884c \u65c5 \u5716 ' (Travelers Among Mountains and Streams), which is the name of the painting painted by 'Fan K'uan/\u8303\u5bec' since the painter's name is strongly collocated with the name of the painting.

'Fan K'uan' may be incorrectly spotted as part of the translation of '\u8c3f\u5c71\u884c\u65c5\u5716', if pure association method is applied. Bai et al. (2009) proposed a normalized frequency criterion to extract translation equivalents form sentence aligned parallel corpus. This criterion takes lexical-level contexture effect into account, so it can effectively resolve the above mentioned effect. But the goal of their method is to find most common translations instead of spotting translations, so the normalized frequency criterion tends to ignore rare translations. In this paper, we propose a bilingual concordancer, DOMCAT, for computer assisted domain-specific term translation. To remedy the above mentioned effects, we extended the normalized frequency of Bai et al. (2009) to a normalized correlation criterion to spot translation equivalents. The normalized correlation inherits the characteristics of normalized frequency and is adjusted for spotting rare translations. These characteristics are especially important for a domain-specific bilingual concordancer to spot translation pairs of low-frequency and semantically non-compositional terms. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the DOMCAT system. In Section 3, we describe the evaluation of the DOMCAT system. Section 4 contains some concluding remarks. The DOMCAT System Given a query, the DOMCAT bilingual concordancer retrieves sentence pairs and spots translation equivalents by the following steps: 1. Retrieve the sentence pairs whose source sentences contain the query term. 2. Extract translation candidate words from the retrieved sentence pairs by the normalized correlation criterion. 3. Spot the candidate words for each target sentence and rank the sentences by normalized the Dice coefficient criterion. In step 1, the query term can be a single word, a phrase, a gapped sequence and even a regular expression. The parallel corpus is indexed by the suffix array to efficiently retrieve the sentences. The step 2 and step 3 are more complicated and will be described from Section 2.1 to Section 2.3. Extract Translation Candidate Words After the queried sentence pairs retrieved from the parallel corpus, we can extract translation candidate words from the sentence pairs. We compute the local normalized correlation with respect to the query term for each word e in each target sentence. The local normalized correlation is defined as follows: \uf0e5 \uf0e5 \uf0ce \uf022 \uf0ce \uf022 \uf044 \uf02b \uf044 \uf02b \uf03d f q f q f e q j i f j f i f e p f e p e lnc | | ) | ( | | ) | ( ) , , ; ( (1) where q denotes the query term, f denotes the source sentence and e denotes the target sentence, \uf044 is a small smoothing factor. The probability p(e|f) is the word translation probability derived from the entire parallel corpus by IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) . The sense of local normalized correlation of e can be interpreted as the probability of word e being part of translation of the query term q under the condition of sentence pair (e, f). Once the local normalized correlation is computed for each word in retrieved sentences, we compute the normalized correlation on the retrieved sentences. The normalized correlation is the average of all lnc values and defined as follows: \uf0e5 \uf03d \uf03d n i i i e lnc n e nc 1 ) ( ) ( ) , , ; ( 1 ) ; ( f e q q (2) where n is the number of retrieved sentence pairs. After the nc values for the words of the retrieved target sentences are computed, we can obtain a translation candidate list by filtering out the words with lower nc values. To compare with the association-based method, we also sorted the word list by the Dice coefficient defined as follows:  The rationale behind the normalized correlation is that the nc value is the strength of word e generated by the query compared to that of generated by the whole sentence. As a result, the normalized correlation can easily separate the words generated by the query term from the words generated by the context. On the contrary, the Dice coefficient counts the frequency of a co-occurred word without considering the fact that it could be generated by the strongly collocated context. ) ( ) ( ) , ( 2 ) , ( q q q freq e Translation Spotting Once we have a translation candidate list and respective nc values, we can spot the translation equivalents by the following spotting algorithm. For each target sentence, first, spot the word with highest nc value. Then extend the spotted sequence to the neighbors of the word by checking their nc values of neighbor words but skipping function words. If the nc value is greater than a threshold \u03b8, add the word into spotted sequence. Repeat the extending process until no word can be added to the spotted sequence. The following is the pseudo-code for the algorithm: Ranking The ranking mechanism of a bilingual concordancer is used to provide the most related translation of the query on the top of the outputs for the user. So, an association metric is needed to evaluate the relations between the query and the spotted translations. The Dice coefficient is a widely used measure for assessing the association strength between a multi-word expression and its translation candidates. (Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996; Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000; Melamed, 2001) The following is the definition of the Dice coefficient: ) ( ) ( ) , ( 2 ) , ( q t q t q t freq freq freq dice \uf02b \uf03d (4) where q denotes a multi-word expression to be translated, t denotes a translation candidate of q. However, the Dice coefficient has the common subsequence effect (as mentioned in Section 1) due to the fact that the co-occurrence frequency of the common subsequence is usually larger than that of the full translation; hence, the Dice coefficient tends to choose the common subsequence. To remedy the common subsequence effect, we introduce a normalized frequency for a spotted sequence defined as follows: \uf0e5 \uf03d \uf03d n i i i lnf nf 1 ) ( ) ( ) , , ; ( ) , ( f e q t q t (5) where lnf is a function which compute normalized frequency locally in each sentence. The following is the definition of lnf: \uf0d5 \uf02d \uf0ce \uf022 \uf02d \uf03d t H f e q f e q t e e lnc lnf )) , , ; ( 1 ( ) , , ; ( (6) where H is the spotted sequence of the sentence pair (e,f), H-t are the words in H but not in t. The rationale behind lnf function is that: when counting the local frequency of t in a sentence pair, if t is a subsequence of H, then the count of t should be reasonably reduced by considering the strength of the correlation between the words in H-t and the query. Then, we modify the Dice coefficient by replacing the co-occurrence frequency with normalized frequency as follows: ) ( ) ( ) , ( 2 ) , ( q t q t q t freq freq nf nf_dice \uf02b \uf03d (7) The new scoring function, nf_dice(t,q), is exploited as our criterion for assessing the association strength between the query and the spotted sequences. Experimental Results Experimental Setting We use the Chinese/English web pages of the National Palace Museum 2 as our underlying parallel corpus. It contains about 30,000 sentences in each language. We exploited the Champollion Toolkit (Ma et al., 2006) to align the sentence pairs. The English sentences are tokenized and lemmatized by using the NLTK (Bird and Loper, 2004) and the Chinese sentences are segmented by the CKIP Chinese segmenter (Ma and Chen, 2003) . To evaluate the performance of the translation spotting, we selected 12 domain-specific terms to query the concordancer. Then, the returned spotted translation equivalents are evaluated against a manually annotated gold standard in terms of recall and precision metrics. We also build two different translation spotting modules by using the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2000) with the intersection/union of the bidirectional word alignment as baseline systems. To evaluate the performance of the ranking criterion, we compiled a reference translation set for each query by collecting the manually annotated translation spotting set and selecting 1 to 3 frequently used translations. Then, the outputs of each query are ranked by the nf_dice function and evaluated against the reference translation set. We also compared the ranking performance with the Dice coefficient. Evaluation of Translation Spotting We evaluate the translation spotting in terms of the Recall and Precision metrics defined as follows: | | | | 1 ) ( 1 ) ( ) ( \uf0e5 \uf0e5 \uf03d \uf03d \uf0c7 \uf03d n i i g n i i i g H H H Recall (8) | | | | 1 ) ( 1 ) ( ) ( \uf0e5 \uf0e5 \uf03d \uf03d \uf0c7 \uf03d n i i n i i i g H H H Precision (9) where i denotes the index of the retrieved sentence, ) (i H is the spotted sequences of the ith sentence returned by the concordancer, and ) (i g H is the gold standard spotted sequences of the ith sentence. Table 1 shows the evaluation of translation spotting for normalized correlation, NC, compared with the intersection and union of GIZA++ word alignment. The F-score of the normalized correlation is much higher than that of the word alignment methods. It is noteworthy that the normalized correlation increased the recall rate without losing the precision rate. This may indicate that the normalized correlation can effectively conquer the drawbacks of the word alignmentbased translation spotting and the associationbased translation spotting mentioned in Section 1. Recall Precision F-score Intersection Evaluation of Ranking To evaluate the performance of a ranking function, we ranked the retrieved sentences of the queries by the function. Then, the top-n sentences of the output are evaluated in terms of the coverage rate defined as follows: The meaning of the coverage rate can be interpreted as: how many percent of the query can find an acceptable translation in the top-n results. We use the reference translations, as described in Section 3.1, as acceptable translation set for each query of our experiment. Table 3 shows the coverage rate of the nf_dice function compared with the Dice coefficient. As it shows, in the outputs ranked by the Dice coefficient, uses usually have to look up more than 3 sentences to find an acceptable translation; while in the outputs ranked by the nf_dice function, users can find an acceptable translation in top-2 sentences. Conclusion and Future Works In this paper, we proposed a bilingual concordancer, DOMCAT, designed as a domainspecific computer assisted translation tool. We exploited a normalized correlation which incorporate lexical level information into association-based method that effectively avoid the drawbacks of the word alignment-based translation spotting as well as the association-based translation spotting. In the future, it would be interesting to extend the parallel corpus to the internet to retrieve more rich data for the computer assisted translation.",
