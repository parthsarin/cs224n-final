This paper presents an experimental evaluation of two alternative response strategies in TOOT, a spoken dialogue agent that allows users to access train schedules stored on the web via a telephone conversation. We compare the performance of two versions of TOOT (literal and cooperative), by having users carry out a set of tasks with each version. By using hypothesis testing methods, we show that a combination of response strategy, application task, and task/strategy interactions account for various types of performance differences. By using the PARADISE evaluation framework to estimate an overall performance function, we identify interdependencies that exist between speech recognition and response strategy. Our results elaborate the conditions under which TOOT' s cooperative rather than literal strategy contributes to greater performance. Introduction The notion of a cooperative response has been the focus of considerable research in natural language and spoken dialogue systems (Allen and Perrault, 1980; Mays, 1980; Kaplan, 1981; Joshi et al., 1984; McCoy, 1989; Pao and Wilpon, 1992; Moore, 1994; Seneff et al., 1995; Goddeau et al., 1996; Pieraccini et al., 1997) . However, despite the existence of many algorithms for generating cooperative responses, there has been little empirical work addressing the evaluation of such algorithms in the context of real-time natural language dialogue systems with human users. Thus it is unclear under what conditions cooperative responses result in more efficient or efficacious dialogues. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of two alternative algorithms for responding to database queries in TOOT, a spoken dialogue agent for accessing online train schedules via a telephone conversation. We conduct an experiment in which 12 users carry out 4 tasks of varying difficulty with one of two versions of TOOT (literal and cooperative TOOT), resulting in a corpus of 48 dialogues. The values for a wide range of evaluation measures are then extracted from this corpus. We analyze our data using both traditional hypothesis testing methods and the PARADISE (Walker et al., 1997; Walker et al., 1998) methodology for estimating a performance function. Hypothesis testing shows that while differences among some evaluation measures depend on the response strategy (literal or cooperative), other differences are a function of application task and task/strategy interactions. A PAR-ADISE assessment of the contribution of each evaluation measure to overall performance shows that strategy-dependent dialogue phenomena as well as phenomena associated with speech recognition significantly predict performance. Our results identify the conditions under which TOOT' s cooperative response strategy leads to greater agent performance. TOOT TOOT allows users to access online AMTRAK train schedules via a telephone dialogue, as in Figure 1 .1 (All examples are from the experiment in Section 3.) We have built two versions of TOOT: literal TOOT (LT) and cooperative TOOT (CT). LT and CT have equivalent functionality, but use different response strategies to present tabular results of web queries in a displayless environment. 2 LT and CT incorporate many of the types of database responses in the IOur domain was chosen to afford future comparison with similar systems, e.g., (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995) . \"Initiative (Walker et al., 1998) and conlirmation (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995) strategies are equivalent in LT and CT, and were chosen to reduce speech recognition errors.  literature into relatively literal and cooperative response strategies. (More sophisticated cooperative strategies could be imagined.) When there is too much information to present in a single utterance, UF groups the information into units of 3 trains, then presents each unit, as in the italicized portion of Figure 1 . In contrast, CT summarizes the range of trains available, then tells the user to either list the trains or further constrain the query. In CT, the italicized portion of Figure 1 would be replaced with the following response: (1) LT's response incrementally presents the set of trains that match the query, until the user tells LT to stop. Enumerating large lists, even incrementally, can lead to information overload. CT's response is more cooperative because it better respects the resource limitations of the listener. CT presents a subset of the matching trains using a summary response (Pao and Wilpon, 1992) , followed by an option to reduce the information to be retrieved (Pieraccini et al., 1997; Goddeau et al., 1996; Seneff et al., 1995; Pao and Wilpon, 1992) . If there is no information that matches a query, LT reports only the lack of an answer to the query, as in the following dialogue excerpt: (2) There ate no trains going to Chicago J)om Philadelphia on Sunday around 10:30 am. Do you want to continue atM find a new set of trains? CT automatically relaxes the user's time constraint and allows the user to perform other relaxations: (3) There are ,to trains going to Chicago from Philadelphia on Sunday around 10:30 atn. The closest earlier train leaves at 9:28 attt evel T day, attd it takes 1 day 3 hours 36 miJts. The closest later train leaves at 11:45 ant on Saturday attd Sund~o; attd it takes 22 hours 5 milts. Please say \"relax\" to change your departure time or travel day or say \"continue\" if nty attswer was sufficient, or say \"repeat\" to hear this ntessage again. CT's response is more cooperative since identifying the source of a query failure can help block incorrect user inferences (Pieraccini et al., 1997; Pao and Wilpon, 1992; Joshi et al., 1984; Kaplan, 1981; Mays, 1980) . LT's response could lead the user to believe that there are no trains on Sunday. When there are I-3 trains that match a query, both LT and CT list the trains: (4) There are 2 trains available around 6 pm. The first train leaves at 6:05 pm every da); attd it rakes 5 hours 10 rains. The second train leaves at 6:30 pm ever), day, and it rakes 2 days 11 hours 30 rains. Do you want to continue and find a new set of trains ? TOOT is implemented using a platform for spoken dialogue agents (Kamm et al., 1997) that combines automatic speech recognition (ASR), textto-speech (TTS), a phone interface, and modules for specifying a dialogue manager and application fnnctions. ASR in our platform supports barge-in, an advanced functionality which allows users to interrupt an agent when it is speaking. The dialogue manager uses a finite state machine to implement dialogue strategies. Each state specifies 1) an initial prompt (or response) which the agent says upon entering the state (such prompts often elicit parameter values); 2) a help prompt which the agent says if the user says help; 3) rejection prompts which the agent says if the confidence level of ASR is too low (rejection prompts typically ask the user to repeat or paraphrase their utterance); and 4) timeout prompts which the agent says if the user doesn't say anything within a specified time frame (timeout prompts are often suggestions about what to say). A context-free grammar specifies what ASR can recognize in each state. Transitions between states are driven by semantic interpretation. TOOT's application functions access and process information on AMTRAK'S web site. Given a set of constraints, the functions return a table listing all matching trains in a specified temporal interval, or within an hour of a specified timepoint. This table is converted to a natural language response which can be realized by TTS through the use of templates for either the LT or the CT response type; values in the table instantiate template variables. Experimental Design The experimental instructions were given on a web page, which consisted of a description of TOOTs functionality, hints for talking to TOOT, and links to 4 task pages. Each task page contained a task scenario, the hints, instructions for calling TOOT, an~l a web survey designed to ascertain the depart and travel times obtained by the user and to measure user perceptions of task success and agent usability. Users were 12 researchers not involved with the design or implementation of TOOT; 6 users were randomly assigned to LT and 6 to CT. Users read the instructions in their office and then called TOOT from their phone. Our experiment yielded a corpus of 48 dialogues (1344 total turns; 214 minutes of speech). Users were provided with task scenarios for two reasons. First, our hypothesis was that performance depended not only on response strategy, but also on task difficulty. To include the task as a factor in our experiment, we needed to ensure that users executed the same tasks and that they varied in difficulty. Figure 2 shows the task scenarios used in our experiment. Our hypotheses about agent performance are summarized in Table 1 . We predicted that optimal performance would occur whenever the correct task solution was included in TOOT' s initial re- sponse to a web query (i.e., when the task was easy). Task 1 (dialogue fragment (4) above) produced a query that resulted in 2 matching trains, one of which was the train requested in the scenario. Since the response strategies of LT and CT were identical under this condition, we predicted identical LT and CT performance, as shown in Table 1.3 Tasks 2 (dialogue fragments (2) and ( 3 )) and 3 led to queries that yielded no matching trains. In Task 2 users were told to find the closest train. Since only CT included this extra information in its response, we predicted that it would perform better than LT. In Task 3 users were told to find the shortest train within a new departure interval. Since neither LT nor CT provided this information initially, we hypothesized comparable LT and CT performance. However, since CT allowed users to change just their departure time while LT required users to construct a whole new query, we also thought it possible that CT might perform slightly better than LT. Task 4 (Figure 1 and dialogue fragment (1)) led to 3Since Task 1 was the easiest, it was always performed first. The order of the remaining tasks was randomized across users. A second reason for having task scenarios was that it allowed us to objectively determine whether users achieved their tasks. Following PAR-ADISE (Walker et al., 1997) , we defined a \"key\" for each scenario using an attribute value matrix (AVM) task representation, as in Table 2 . The key indicates the attribute values that must be exchanged between the agent and user by the end of the dialogue. If the task is successfully completed in a scenario execution (as in Figure 1 ), the AVM representing the dialogue is identical to the key. Measuring Aspects of Performance Once the experiment was completed, values for a range of evaluation measures were extracted from the resulting data (dialogue recordings, system logs, and web survey responses). Following PARADISE, we organize our measures along four performance dimensions, as shown in Figure 3 . To measure task success, we compared the scenario key and scenario execution AVMs for each dialogue, using the Kappa statistic (Walker et al., 1997) . For the scenario execution AVM, the values for arrival-city, depart-city, depart-day, and departrange were extracted from system logs of ASR re- suits. The exact-depart-time and total-travel-time were extracted from the web survey. To measure users' percel)tions of task success, the survey also asked users whether they had successfully Completed the task. To measure dialogue quality or naturalness, we logged the dialogue manager's behavior on entering and exiting each state in the finite state machine (recall Section 2). We then extracted the number of prompts per dialogue due to Help Requests, ASR Rejections, and Timeouts. Obtaining the values for other quality measures required manual analysis. We listened to the recordings and compared them to the logged ASR results, to calculate concept accuracy (intuitively, semantic interpretation accuracy) for each utterance. This was then used, in combination with ASR rejections, to compute a Mean Recognition score per dialogue. We also listened to the recordings to determine how many times the user interrupted the agent (Barge Ins). To measure dialogue efficiency, the number of System Turns and User Turns were extracted from the dialogue manager log, and the total Elapsed Time was determined from the recording. To measure user satisfaction 4, users responded to the web survey in Figure 4 , which assessed their subjective evaluation of the agent's performance. Each question was designed to measure a pattie-4Questionnaire-based user satisfaction ratings (Shriberg et al., 1992; Polifroni et al., 1992) have been frequently used in the literature as an external indicator of agent usability. \u2022 Was the system easy to understand in this conversation?

(Future Use) Strategy and Task Differences To test the hypotheses in Table 1 we use analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Cohen, 1995) to determine whether the values of any of the evaluation measures in Figure 3 significantly differ as a function of response strategy and task scenario. First, for each task scenario (4 sets of 12 dialogues, 6 per agent and 1 per user), we perform an ANOVA for each evaluation measure as a function of response strategy. For Task 1, there are no significant differences between the 6 LT and 6 CT dialogues for any evaluation measure, which is consistent with Table 1 . For Task 2, mean Completed (perceived task success rate) is 50% for LT and 100% for CT (p < .05). In addition, the average number of Help Requests per LT dialogue is 0, while for CT the average is 2.2 (p < .05). Thus, for Task 2, CT has a better perceived task success rate than LT, despite the fact that users needed more help to use CT. Only the perceived task success difference is consistent with the Task 2 prediction in Table 1 . 5 For Task 3, there are no significant differences between LT and CT, which again matches our predictions. Finally, for Task 4, mean Kappa (actual task success rate) is 100% for LT but only 65% for CT (p < .01). 6 Like Task 2, this result suggests that some type of task success measure is an important predictor of agent performance. Surprisingly, we found that LT and CT did not differ with respect to any efficiency measure, in any task] Next, we combine all of our data (48 dialogues), and perform a two-way ANOVA for each evaluation measure as a function of strategy and task. An interaction between response strategy and task scenario is significant for Future Use (p < .03). For task 1, the likelihood of Future Use is the same for LT and CT; for task 2, the likelihood is higher for CT; for tasks 3 and 4, the likelihood is higher for LT. Thus, the results for tasks 1, 2, and 4, but not for Task 3, are consistent with the predictions in Table 1 . However, Task 3 was the most difficult task (see below), and sometimes led to unexpected user behavior with both agents. A strategy/task interaction is also significant for Help Requests (p < .02). For tasks 1 and 3, the number of requests is higher for LT; for tasks 2 and 4, the number is higher for CT. No evaluation measures significantly differ as a function of response strategy, which is consistent with Table 1 . Since the task scenarios were constructed to yield comparable performance in Tasks 1 and 3, better CT performance in Task 2, and better LT performance in Task 4, we expected that overall, LT and CT performance would be cotnparable. In contrast, many measures (User Satisfaction, Elapsed Time, System Turns, User Turns, ASR Performance, and Task Ease) differ as a function of task scenario (p < .03), confirming that our tasks vary with respect to difficulty. Our results suggest that the ordering of the tasks from easiest to most difficult is 1, 4, 2, and 3, 8 which is consistent with our predictions. Recall that for Task 1, the initial query was designed to yield the correct train for both LT and CT. For tasks 4 and 2, the initial query was designed to yield the correct train for only one agent, and to require a follow-up query for the other. 5However, the analysis in Section 6 suggests that Help Requests is not a good predictor of pertbrmance. 61n our data, actual task success implies perceived task success, but not vice-versa. 7However, our \"difficult\" tasks were not that difficult (we wanted to minimize subjects' time commitment). SThis ordering is observed for all the listed measures except User Turns, which reverses tasks 4 and 1. For Task 3, the initial query was designed to require a follow-up query for both agents. Performance Function Estimation While hypothesis testing tells us how each evaluation measure differs as a function of strategy and/or task, it does not tell us how to tradeoff or combine results from multiple measures. Understanding such tradeoffs is especially important when different measures yield different performance predictions (e.g., recall the Task 2 hypothesis testing results for Completed and Help Requests). To assess the relative contribution of each evaluation measure to performance, we use PAR-ADISE (Walker et al., 1997) to derive a performance function from our data. PARADISE draws on ideas in multi-attribute decision theory (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976) to posit the model shown in Figure 5 , then uses multivariate linear regression to estimate a quantitative performance function based on this model. Linear regression produces coefficients describing the relative contribution of predictor factors in accounting for the variance in a predicted factor. In PARADISE, the success and cost measures are predictors, while user satisfaction is predicted. Figure 3 showed how the measures used to evaluate TOOT instantiate the PARADISE model. The application of PARADISE to the TOOT data shows that the only significant contributors to User (Cohen, 1995) and guarantees that the coeffi-9Since we measure recognition rather than misrecognition, this \"'cost\" thctor has a positive coefficient. cients directly indicate the relative contribution of each factor to performance. Our performance function demonstrates that TOOT performance involves task success and dialogue quality factors. Analysis of variance suggested that task success was a likely performance factor. PARADISE confirms this hypothesis, and demonstrates that perceived rather than actual task success is the useful predictor. While 39 dialogues were perceived to have been successful, only 27 were actually successful. Results that were not apparent from the analysis of variance are that Mean Recognition and Barge Ins are also predictors of performance. The mean recognition for our corpus is 85%. Apparently, users of both LT and CT are bothered by dialogue phenomena associated with poor recognition. For example, system misunderstandings (which result from ASR misrecognitions) and system requests to repeat what users have said (which result from ASR rejections) both make dialogues seem less natural. While barge-in is usually considered an advanced (and desirable) ASR capability, our performance function suggests that in TOOT, allowing users to interrupt actually degrades performance. Examination of our transcripts shows that users sometimes use barge-in to shorten TOOTs prompts. This often circumvents TOOTs confirmation strategy, which incorporates speech recognition results into prompts to make the user aware of misrecognitions. Surprisingly, no efficiency measures are significant predictors of performance. This draws into question the frequently made assumption that ell ficiency is one of the most important measures of system performance, and instead suggests that users are more attuned to both task success and qualitative aspects of the dialogue, or that efficiency is highly correlated with some of these factors. However, analysis of subsets of our data suggests that efficiency measures can become important performance predictors when the more primary effects are factored out. For example, when a regression is performed on the 11 TOOT dialogues with perfect Mean Recognition, the significant contributors to performance become Completed (p < .05), Elapsed time (p < .04), User Turns (p < .03) and Barge Ins (p < 0.0007) (accounting for 87% of the variance). Thus, in the presence of perfect ASR, efficiency becomes important. When a regression is performed using the 39 dialogues where users thought they had successfully completed the task (perfect Completed), the significant factors become Elapsed time (p < .002), Timeouts (p < .002), and Barge Ins (p < .02) (58% of the variance). Applying the performance function to each of our 48 dialogues yields a performance estimate for each dialogue. Analysis with these estimates shows no significant differences for mean LT and CT performance. This result is consistent with the ANOVA result, where only one of the three (comparably weighted) factors in the performance function depends on response strategy (Completed). Note that for Tasks 2 and 4, the predictions in Table 1 do not hold for overall performance, despite the ANOVA results that the predictions do hold for some evaluation measures (e.g., Completed in Task 2). Conclusion We have presented an empirical comparison of literal and cooperative query response strategies in TOOT, illustrating the advantages of combining hypothesis testing and PARADISE. By using hypothesis testing to examine how a set of evaluation measures differ as a function of response strategy and task, we show that TOOT's cooperative and literal responses can both lead to greater task success, likelihood of future use, and user need for help, depending on task. By using PARADISE to derive a performance function, we show that a combination of strategy-dependent (perceived task success) and strategy-independent (number of barge-ins, mean recognition score) evaluation measures best predicts overall TOOT performance. Our results elaborate the conditions under which TOOT' s response strategies lead to greater performance, and allow us to make predictions. For example, our performance equation predicts that improving mean recognition and/or judiciously restricting the use of barge-in will enhance performance. Our current research is aimed at automatically adapting dialogue behavior in TOOT, to increase mean recognition and thus overall agent performance (Walker et al., 1998) . Future work utilizing PARADISE will attempt to generalize our results, to make a more predictive model of agent performance. Performance function estimation needs to be done iteratively over different tasks and dialogue strategies. We plan to evaluate additional cooperative response strategies in TOOT (e.g., intensional summaries (Kalita et al., 1986) , summarization and constraint elicitation in isolation), and to combine TOOT data with data from other agents (Walker et al., 1998) .
