Introduction The rapidly growing appearance rate of biomedical publications has increased interest in applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies to navigate the massive volumes of biomedical literature. In particular, the use of text annotation to better automate knowledge extraction and identify relevant information in the literature has become an increasingly major activity over the past decade. Numerous platforms and frameworks that support text annotation have been developed, including the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE (Cunningham et al., 2013) ), CLARIN WebLicht (Hinrichs et al., 2010) , the Language Applications (LAPPS) Grid (Ide et al., 2014) , OpenMinTeD (Labropoulou et al., 2018) , and several systems based on the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA (Ferrucci et al., 2009) ), e.g. ARGO (Rak et al., 2013) , Apache cTAKES (Savova et al., 2010) , DKPro Core (Eckart de Castilho and Gurevych, 2014) . However, due to factors such as the often highly domain-specific vocabularies in specialized areas of science, these frameworks are rarely usable outof-the-box. As a result, scholars interested in mining publications may spend considerable effort to adapt existing annotation tools and resources to their particular domains of research (e.g., tune them to domain-specific terminology), a process referred to as domain adaptation. Machine-assisted interactive annotation (also known as human-in-the-loop annotation) is a recognized means to support domain adaptation, by enabling the rapid creation of benchmark annotation data for specialized domains, which can be used for training or adapting annotation models and evaluating their performance. This process requires several capabilities, including ready access to (1) relevant document repositories, (2) retrainable NLP tools (e.g., named entity recognizers), and (3) sophisticated annotation editors that integrate retraining into the interactive annotation process. However, because all of these capabilities are not available within any single text mining platform, the researcher must use multiple platforms and tools. And although tools and resources may be interoperable within a single platform, combining tools and resources across platforms can demand substantial computational expertise. One approach to solve this problem would be to develop a monolithic framework that incorporates all of the requisite functionalities. Our solution is instead to interconnect three independently developed platforms, each of which supports some aspect(s) of the domain adaptation process, but none of which provides the entire suite of required tools and resources. This necessitates adaptations to achieve interoperability among them-i.e., to be able to exchange data among the platforms without the need for explicit conversion. In this paper, we describe three platforms that constitute our annotation ecosystem, as background for a demonstration of their ability to work in concert to provide easily usable means to adapt NLP processes to specific domains. Our focus is on the use of the ecosystem to address text mining in the biomedical domain, but the strategies outlined are readily applied to other areas of science. Platforms This section briefly introduces the three platforms comprising our ecosystem (Figure 1 ) . Each represents a particular class of systems: a repository for annotated corpora, an NLP services platform, and an interactive annotation platform. These are introduced as platforms and not as tools as they are designed as open and extensible software systems. All are open source software and users can set up their own installations, e.g. for their own project, lab, or community. Some also run a canonical instance accessible to any registered user. PubAnnotation (Kim and Wang, 2012) takes on the role of the annotation repository in our ecosystem. It links all contributed annotations through references to canonical texts. It also supports annotation development coupled with Pub-Dictionaries, a similarly open repository of dictionaries (term lexicons, etc.) to which users can add by registering their own dictionaries or modifying those already in the repository; as well as TextAE, a browser-based visualizer/editor for text annotation. The service-oriented architecture makes it easy for end-users to customize annotation tools by engaging in the annotation process from start to finish. It consists of a collection of web services and web clients that can interact with other systems through REST APIs and a JSON-based data format. The SPARQL standard is supported and allows searching the linked annotations. The LAPPS Grid (Ide et al., 2014) acts as the NLP services platform in our ecosystem. It provides a large collection of NLP tools exposed as web services, together with a variety of commonly used resources (e.g., gold standard corpora). The services and resources are made available via a web-based workflow development engine 1 , directly via SOAP calls, and programmatically through Java and Python interfaces. All tools and resources in the LAPPS Grid are rendered mutually interoperable via transduction to the JSON-LD LAPPS Grid Interchange Format (LIF (Verhagen et al., 2016) ) and the Web Service Exchange Vocabulary (WSEV (Ide et al., 2016) ), both designed to capture fundamental properties of existing annotation models in order to serve as a common pivot among them. INCEpTION (Klie et al., 2018) contributes interactive annotation functionality to the ecosys-tem. The platform can be configured for different annotation tasks through a configurable annotation schema supporting span and relation annotation that can carry different kinds of attributes (string, numeric, boolean, etc.) . It connects to external document repositories in order to search and import documents for later annotation. Automatic recommenders provide annotation suggestions by connecting to external NLP services or by using internal machine learning libraries. To support domain adaptation, the suggestions can be improved as the user interactively reviews and corrects them. Domain-specific vocabularies can be accessed from external SPARQL endpoints or be managed in an internal RDF knowledge base. By supporting common formats and standards for annotation representation and knowledge representation, INCEpTION offers a high level of interoperability. Through its remote API, it can be integrated into external workflows. The implementation is internally using the UIMA CAS (G\u00f6tz and Suhre, 2004 ) data model. To create a domain adaptation ecosystem from these three independent platforms, it is necessary to establish cross-platform interoperability, i.e., the ability to exchange data consisting of text and associated annotations among them. This means that the data must be mutually understandable at the data level (model and schema), either directly or via trivial conversion. It must also be possible to appropriately utilize data from the other platforms within the constraints of their respective architectures. In the present paper, we focus on the cross-platform scenario and on the possible actions that can be taken, while a detailed description of the challenges for interoperability among the three platforms at a more technical level and the implemented solutions is provided by Eckart de Castilho et al. (2019) . Domain Adaptation for Biomedical Publications A principal requirement for effective information mining from biomedical texts is the identification of biologically and clinically relevant concepts, e.g., genes and gene products, diseases, and treatments, in the vast body of available data. Domain adaptation for biomedical texts therefore centers around the development and refining of applications for named entity recognition (NER), for which numerous freely available tools exist.  Even given the several NER tools and frameworks that have been developed with biomedical entities in mind, including for example the Genia tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2005) , GOST tagger (El-Haj et al., 2018) , Termine, 2 the Penn BioTagger 3 (Jin et al., 2006) , and OGER++ (Furrer et al., 2019) , results are rarely comprehensive and reliable enough to be immediately usable for serious text mining. More importantly, such tools typically cover only very general categories of bioen-2 http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine/ 3 http://seas.upenn.edu/\u223cstrctlrn/BioTagger/BioTagger.html tities, often miss variant bioentity names, and fail to identify newly introduced terms that appear as disciplines progress. State-of-the-art NER systems employ supervised or semi-supervised machine learning. Supervised learning requires pre-annotated gold standard data from which to learn relevant patterns and features for later annotation of previously unseen data. Semi-supervised learning may also use gold standard annotations, but often relies on information contained in lexicons and ontologies to identify entities in the text. Therefore, adapting NER strategies to a new domain or sub-domain may require the manual creation of gold standard data or manual intervention by an expert to correct the output of automatic NER software. The creation and/or augmentation of lexicons and similar supporting resources is also typically necessary in order to provide domain-specific terminology used in semi-supervised settings. As an example, consider a researcher investigating recent advances in gene interaction research documented in publications from a document repository such as PubMed Central. The researcher will typically build a corpus by selecting a set of appropriate texts from the repository, but in order to find the desired information, it is necessary to identify mentions of the entities in which he or she is interested. This demands that the researcher annotates the corpus by applying an NER text analysis service to identify potential gene mentions in the data. However, even specialized NER tools (Furrer et al., 2019) for the biomedical domain perform at rates of about 0.56 F1-score, at best. At this point, human intervention is required to revise the annotations by correcting mis-identified occurrences of gene names as well as annotating gene names that the tagger missed. A sophisticated annotation editor that learns from the user's activity and proposes new annotations or modifications can significantly increase the speed of the correction process. The revised annotations are then used to re-train a machine learning algorithm that can be applied to other, unannotated texts; results are evaluated, and the training texts are corrected anew, where necessary, by the human user. The researcher repeats this overall cycle as many times as necessary until a satisfactory result is obtained. Note that there are two human-in-the-loop cycles here: a tight cycle, where a classifier is trained within the annotation editor itself to assist the user, and a larger cycle where a classifier is separately trained and used to annotate the corpus. The above describes only one possible scenario using the combined functionalities of PubAnnotation, the LAPPS Grid, and INCEpTION to create texts annotated for biomedical entities. The three platforms are mutually interconnectable, and so it is possible to initiate one's corpus building/annotation activity from within any one of them and move to the others as needed, without the need to explicitly export data from one platform and import it to another or convert formats to enable cross-platform communication. Table 1 summarizes the extent to which each platform supports the various steps in the domain adaptation process and how it can interconnect with the other platforms to address a given step. Figure 1 provides a graphic rendering of possible interactions among the platforms. Conclusion Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use framework to support mining of biomedical publications and, ultimately, scientific publications, by providing an ecosystem that facilitates the rapid development of corpora annotated for phenomena in specific domains and sub-domains. We accomplish this by leveraging the capabilities of three independently developed systems, rather than attempting to develop a single, monolithic system. While monolithic systems tend to be faster to build and are able to better reflect the needs of a particular use case, their maintenance and long-term sustainability is limited by the attention of their developer community. An approach combining the capabilities of multiple platforms reduces the risk of becoming unmaintained. And, even if one platform becomes unavailable or no longer maintained, making them interoperable inherently requires the development of suitable and generic APIs and data formats, which in turn facilitates connecting with new platforms to replace a lost one or expand the overall ecosystem. For users, this means a reduced risk of being locked in to a particular technology and the ability to pick and combine tools best suited for their task from a wider selection.
