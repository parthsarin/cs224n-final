The semantic layer shows how predicates and their arguments are involved in a situation described in an utterance. These two layers are connected, representing how semantic arguments can be realised on the surface. Walenty also contains a powerful phraseological (idiomatic) component. Walenty has been created and can be accessed remotely with a dedicated tool called Slowal. In this article, we focus on most important functionalities of this system. First, we will depict how to access the dictionary and how built-in filtering system (covering both syntactic and semantic phenomena) works. Later, we will describe the process of creating dictionary by Slowal tool that both supports and controls the work of lexicographers. Introduction Walenty (Walenty, 2016) is a comprehensive valence dictionary of Polish developed at the Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy of Sciences (ICS PAS) (Przepi\u00f3rkowski et al., 2014a; Przepi\u00f3rkowski et al., 2014b) . The dictionary is meant to be both human-and machinereadable; in particular, it is being employed by two parsers of Polish-\u015awigra 1 (Woli\u0144ski, 2004) and POLFIE 2 (Patejuk and Przepi\u00f3rkowski, 2012) . The former, \u015awigra, is an implementation of the DCG (Pereira and Warren, 1980) grammar of Polish of \u015awidzi\u0144ski (1992) . The latter, POLFIE, is an implementation of an LFG (Bresnan, 1982; Dalrymple, 2001) grammar of Polish. As these parsers are based on two rather different linguistic approaches, the valence dictionary must be sufficiently expressive to accommodate for the needs of both -and perhaps other to come. The dictionary is based on rigorous rules. First, lexicon entries have a strictly defined formal structure. Second, represented syntactic and semantic phenomena should be attested in linguistic reality. Last but not least, the structure of the dictionary should enable flexible access. This concerns several formats (text, XML, PDF) the dictionary can be exported to as well as the possibility of constructing its sub-dictionaries (e.g., phraseological, concerning particular linguistic phenomena). The assumptions listed above could not be met if Walenty had been created in a traditional way. Therefore, it is stored as a database (with a fairly complicated internal structure) and accessed by a dedicated tool called Slowal, aimed to insert, correct, process and search lexical data. The dictionary is developed remotely, by means of an Internet browser. Its entries are elaborated by a highly qualified lexicographers team with precise permissions concerning 1 http://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/ \u015awigra 2 http://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/LFG the scope of lexical entries edition. On the other hand, browsing the dictionary (without possibility of changing anything) is available for anyone by accessing the page http://walenty.ipipan.waw.pl/. Walenty contains valence information for verbs and, to a lesser extent, for nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. 3 It consists of two layers, syntactic and semantic, which are directly connected. Syntactic layer covers a rich phraseological component (Przepi\u00f3rkowski et al., 2014b) , but there is no space in this article to discuss it. Its advantage over other Polish valence dictionaries is a number of novel features, including the structural case, clausal subjects, distributive PO, complex prepositions, comparative constructions, control and raising and semantically defined phrase types (Przepi\u00f3rkowski et al., 2014a) , and non-standard coordination (Patejuk, 2015) . Other important Polish valence dictionaries were created by Pola\u0144ski (1980 Pola\u0144ski ( -1992) ) and \u015awidzi\u0144ski (1994) . A corpusbased dictionary including some valence information is (Ba\u0144ko, 2000) . Thorough comparison with VALLEX (\u017dabokrtsk\u00fd and Lopatkov\u00e1, 2007) was conducted by Przepi\u00f3rkowski et al. (2016) . Comparison of the semantic layer of Walenty with other formalisms can be found in (Hajnicz et al., 2016) . Furthermore, the formalism used in Walenty and Slowal tool can be easily adapted for other morphosyntactically rich languages with free word order (e.g. most Slavic languages). Basic dictionary structure Each lexical entry is identified by its lemma (e.g. AFIR-MACJA 'affirmation', BA \u0106 'fear', POWIEDZIE \u0106 'say'). It does not contain the reflexive mark SI \u0118 even if it is obligatory (e.g., BA \u0106 SI \u0118). If a verb has forms both with reflexive mark SI \u0118 and without it, they will be noted under a single entry (e.g., MARTWI \u0106, MARTWI \u0106 SI \u0118) Syntactic layer Information about reflexive mark, aspect, predicativity 4 and negation divide entries into subentries. For instance, the entry for BA \u0106 has one subentry ba \u0107 si \u0119 (_, , imperf). Any subentry consists of a number of syntactic valence schemata and each schema is a list of syntactic positions. If two morphosyntactically different phrases may occur coordinated in an argument position, they are taken to be different realisations of the same argument. Therefore, a syntactic position is a set of phrase types. For example, schema (1) for the verb BA \u0106 SI \u0118 'fear' has an argument position with realisations of multiple types. In (2) there is a coordinated phrase consisting of an np (bezrobocia 'unemployment') and a that-clause (\u017ce zabraknie Ci \u015brodk\u00f3w na utrzymanie 'that you will have not enough money for livelihood', represented as cp(\u017ce)). (1) (2) Boisz si\u0119 bezrobocia i \u017ce zabraknie Ci \u015brodk\u00f3w na utrzymanie? fear.SEC.SG self unemployment.ACC.SG and you.DAT miss.TER.SG resources.GEN.PL for livelihood.ACC.SG '[You] are afraid of unemployment and that you will have not enough money for livelihood?' There are two labelled argument positions -subject and object. Usual phrase types are considered, such as nominal phrases (np), prepositional phrases (prepnp), adjectival phrases (adjp), clausal phrases (cp), etc. Phrase types can be further parameterised by corresponding grammatical categories, e.g., np and adjp -by information concerning case. Note that the underscore symbol '_' denotes any value of a grammatical category, e.g., infp(_) denotes infinitival phrase of any aspect. A phenomenon connected with whole positions is control and raising (Rosenbaum, 1967; Landau, 2013) , implementing the difference between KAZA \u0106 'order' and OBIECA \u0106 'promise'. The corresponding positions are labelled with controller and controllee. In Polish, this distinction does not only matter for semantic interpretation, but is also correlated with certain agreement facts, i.e., it is useful even for purely syntactic parsers. It can be exemplified in schema (3) for the verb BA \u0106 SI \u0118 'fear', cf. (4). 4 Only for adjectives and adverbs, empty for verbs and nouns. (3) (4) Julek boi si\u0119 wyg\u0142upi\u0107. Named Entity.SG.NOM fear.TER.SG self make a fool.INF 'Julek is afraid of making a fool of himself.' The related phenomenon is raised subject E for verbs such as ZACZ \u0104 \u0106 'start', which inherits subject structure from its infinitival complement. Each schema has its assessment attached, indicating its correctness (pewny 'certain', w \u0105tpliwy 'disputable', z\u0142y 'wrong') and register (potoczny 'colloquial', archaiczny 'archaic', wulgarny 'vulgar'). Semantic layer The semantic layer is composed of semantic frames. Each frame is a set of semantic arguments represented as pairs semantic role, selectional preferences . Each frame is connected to at least one PLWORDNET (plWordNet, 2016) lexical unit (LU) identifying its meaning. If two LUs correspond to the same frame, they are both ascribed to it. On the other hand, exemplary sentences are linked to LUs appropriate for the meaning of the predicate. More information about the semantic layer is presented in (Hajnicz et al., 2016) . Particular phrase types or a whole syntactic position being a syntactic realisation of an argument are linked to the argument, which is marked by the same colouring. All phrase types in a schema adequate for the particular meaning (frame) are linked, indicating that this schema is a syntactic realisation of that meaning. As in the syntactic layer, each frame has its assessment attached. The only difference is additional opinion value marking a metaphorical meaning of a frame (metaforyczna 'metaphorical'). Accessing Slowal as guest A screenshot from Slowal 5 interface for unauthenticated users is presented in Fig. 1 . On top, main views are listed. Has\u0142a ('Entries') view allows viewing and editing entries. Editing is possible only for authenticated users with proper permissions. Administracja ('Administration') tab allows to view general statistics of the dictionary. Rozwini \u0119cia typ\u00f3w fraz ('Phrase type realisations') is used for special phrase types having several realisations. Only super-lexicographers can add, delete and modify those realisations. Pobierz s\u0142ownik ('Download dictionary') is used for downloading a current version of Walenty dictionary in textual format. Entries view The Has\u0142a tab provides access to the actual dictionary. It has three subtabs designed for presenting syntactic layer, 'block' is presented in Fig. 1 . The list of entries together with their current status 6 appears on the left, the list of schemata grouped into subentries appears on the right. In order to find a particular entry, one can enter its lemma in the search field above the list of entries. A single schema is presented as a table with columns representing syntactic positions. After clicking on a particular schema, examples connected with it appear at the bottom. Each exemplary sentence is marked with its source information (particular NKJP subcorpus (NKJP, 2012), cf. (Przepi\u00f3rkowski et al., 2012) , linguistic literature, etc.). In turn, clicking a particular sentence highlights phrase types appearing in it. Semantic layer is visualised together with syntactic layersemantic frames on the left and syntactic schemata on the right. After clicking a frame, all schemata linked to that frame become coloured accordingly to the semantic arguments represented by particular positions and phrase types (see Fig. 2 ). Filtering Users browsing a dictionary are often interested in particular valence phenomena rather than concrete entry representation. Therefore, Slowal allows to use a filtering form (cf. Fig. 3 ), available by means of button positioned just above the list of entries. The filter form is divided into three tabs grouping filters by scope: \u2022 Has\u0142o ('Entry') for filtering entries by their general properties (cf.  At each development phase one can distinguish three types of progress stages: 'w obr\u00f3bce' (eng. in progress) when entry is processed, 'gotowe' (eng. ready) when entry is ready but has not been checked by the super-lexicographer and 'sprawdzone' (eng. checked) when entry is finished and ready for next stage of development. The special 'zal \u0105\u017ckowe' (eng. embryo) status is for entries with low frequency which will not be developed beyond syntactic stage. Schematy filter tab Entries can be further filtered by basic schema properties like: schema assessment (Opinia o schemacie) and type of schema (Typ schematu), with two possible values -phraseologic (frazeologiczny) and normal (normalny). Other schema based filters are related with subentry characteristics such as reflexivity (Zwrotno\u015b\u0107), negation (Negatywno\u015b\u0107), predicativity (Predykatywno\u015b\u0107) and aspect (Aspekt). The most important schema filtering options concern phrase types (Posiada typ frazy) and whole positions (Posiada pozycj\u0119). The simplest way is to type the whole phrase type or position in the corresponding field. For instance, inserting obj{np(inst)} into position constraints field finds all verbs having a nominal phrase in instrumental on its object position Constraints on phrase types and positions work in a similar way as Lemat field in the Has\u0142o filter tab. They are regular expressions (without bracketing). For instance, inserting obj{.+} into position constraints finds all passivisable verbs, whereas inserting infp(perf) into phrase type constraints field finds all entries having infinitival arguments in perfect aspect. Disjunctions (|) and conjunctions (&) of constraints are possible. For instance, subj{. * }&obj{. * } finds verbs having schemata with both subject and object. Particular phrase types or positions can also be forbidden (with !). For instance, subj{. * }&!obj{. * } finds verbs having schemata with a subject and without an object. Again, disjunction has higher priority than conjunction. All filter fields from Schematy filter tab are used simultaneously, an entry is filtered out if none of its schemata matches all specified constraints. Additionally, if the field Odfiltruj niepasuj \u0105ce schematy (eng. Filter out nonmatching schemata) is chosen, only matching schemata will appear. Ramy filter tab The last filter tab serves for filtering entries by semantic phenomena. Its filter fields can be divided into two groups: one representing general features (at this stage limited to the frame assessments (Opinia o ramie)), and the other -constrains on semantic arguments. Semantic arguments filters are defined using disjunctive normal form (DNF). One can add a new argument to the filter by clicking ('Add') button or remove it by pushing ('Delete') next to an already defined argument. Arguments are added as conjoined to the last (open) conjunction. Groups of arguments can be separated by 'or' (pol. lub) relation, which is achieved by clicking ('Lub') button. Moreover, each argument can be marked as negative for 'match all, except' constraint. Each argument is defined by a semantic role (Rola) followed by an attribute (Atrybut) and a set of selectional preferences. To add a selectional preference filter, one must select its type on the dropdown list (Preferencje selekcyjne) and add it to the argument using ('Add') button. Based on preference type, different fields will be added to the filter form: dropdown list for predefined preferences (Predefiniowana), text field with autocorrection for a PLWORDNET synset (S\u0142owosie\u0107) and 3 dropdown lists (for selecting relation type and target of this relation) for relation-based selectional preferences (Relacja). For more information about selectional preferences and semantic arguments, see (Hajnicz et al., 2016) . Phrase types realisations Some information that has been intentionally separated from the rest of the dictionary is available under the Rozwini \u0119cia typ\u00f3w fraz (eng. Phrase types realisations) tab. This concerns composed prepositions comprepnp such as na temat ('about', literally 'on subject') and semantically-defined argument types xp, including locative, ablative, temporal, manner, etc. 7 Composed prepositions are represented by mechanisms elaborated for phraseology, similarly as distinguished possessive phrases possp. This method allows to simplify the structure of the dictionary and ensures its cohesion. All realisations of xp(mod) (manner), being an argument of verbs like TRAKTOWA \u0106 'treat' are presented in Fig. 4 . Dictionary creation procedure Creating a resource as big as Walenty is a serious challenge. It is organised as a chain of performance: syntactic, phraseological and semantic components are elaborated sequentially (by a lexicographer and a supervising lexicographer in each phase). Users have particular access permissions, determining what changes they can make in the dictionary. The super-lexicographers can make particular portions of entries available for particular lexicographers, which en-ables a sort of specialisations (e.g., for verb, noun and adverb subdictionaries). On the other hand, the entries finished in one phase constitute an input for the next one. This way of organisation serves for maximising cohesion of the resource on one hand and improving the parallel work on the other. Elaboration of a single entry Entries are elaborated withing Has\u0142a view. Filtering entries enables (among others) finding entries lexicographer is currently working on or can start working on. Slowal interface for the authenticated user (in this case super-lexicographer) can be seen in Fig. 5 . The actual work is performed in the right panel. First, a lexicographer has to assign an (unassigned) entry to himself. Status tab allows the lexicographer to assign an entry to himself, to withdraw such assignment and to finish work on an entry. It also shows all users working on that entry during previous stages. Lexicographers preparing syntactic layer work on the Schematy 'Schemata' tab, whereas lexicographers preparing semantic layer work on the Semantyka 'Semantics' tab. The Notatki 'Notes' tab displays all notes on an entry, the Podgl \u0105d has\u0142a 'Entry preview' tab serves for viewing other, potentially similar entries, and the Kontrola zmian 'Change control' tab serves for checking changes made by lexicographers during various phases of work. Elaboration of the syntax layer Lexicographers working on syntax layer are supposed to elaborate syntactic schemata appropriate for a particular predicate and illustrate them by corresponding exemplary sentences. The lexicographer can add, delete, copy and modify elements using buttons available at the bottom of a window or using keyboard shortcuts. They work accordingly to which element is active: the whole schema, a particular position, a particular phrase type or none at all. Elements can be copied from another entry available via Podgl \u0105d has\u0142a 'Entry preview' tab. Clicking ('Add') button starts the procedure of adding new element. All information concerning any particular element is selected from predefined lists. The only exception are lemmas of the phraseological component. Double clicking enables edition of a selected element. For instance, for a given position, only subj or obj marks on one hand and information concerning control on the other hand can be chosen. Other tabs at the bottom of the window allows editing and viewing exemplary sentences connected to a schema. They are represented as a simple text, with possibility of marking arguments of a corresponding predicate that are present in it. Some examples can be added from Sk\u0142adnica treebank (Woli\u0144ski et al., 2011) but this concerns only most frequent verbs and their most frequent syntactic constructions. Sk\u0142adnica contains information about syntactic dependants which enables semiautomatic assignment of examples to schemata. Elaboration of the semantic layer As the syntactic layer is introduced as the first one, the semantic layer is elaborated with regard to it. Elaborating the semantic layer is composed of two tasks. The first one consists of linking sentences illustrating the entry with the PLWORDNET lexical units adequate for the entry (having the same lemma) and adding new units if they are missing. The second task is to create semantic frames. The semanticist can create a new frame or modify the existing ones. A new frame has to be assigned to at least one lexical unit. The resulting frame is empty. In order to add a new argument to a frame, the semanticist has to choose a whole position or a single phrase type in a schema being its syntactic realisation, and then chose a semantic role from a table (see Fig. 6 ). Selectional preferences are added independently afterwards. Both predefined preferences and those defined by means of relations to another argument are chosen from a list. In order to determine selectional preferences by means of a particular PLWORDNET synset, a semanticist has to introduce the lemma of a lexical unit (representing it) manually. Each argument can be attached to or detached from whole positions or particular phrase types. Additional filtering options Automatic support Using a dedicated tool for elaborating a valence dictionary enables us to support and control the work of lexicographers. The simplest part of the control is using predefined lists, which eliminate spelling errors etc. and enforce consistency with the Walenty representation language. Next, the consistency of parameters such as aspect of verbs, lemmas of lexical units (with PLWORDNET) and phraseological arguments is checked using the morphological analyser Morfeusz (Morfeusz, 2013), cf. (Woli\u0144ski, 2006; Woli\u0144ski, 2014) . Some other aspects of consistency, such as at most one subj and obj label in a schema, protecting against assigning the same semantic argument to phrase types from different syntactic positions etc., are controlled. For exemplary sentences, filling all required fields is checked. Examples with no attested source (from Internet or created by a lexicographer) have to be confirmed by super-lexicographers. Additionally, for non-standard coordination, examples are required. The above rules cannot be violated. There is also some support and control in form of suggestions, based on the dictionary statistics. For instance, this concern frequent coordinations. First, they are suggested while adding a new phrase type to a position. Second, a suggestion of merging two schemata differing only in frequently coordinating phrase type appears during consistency checking. Consistency checking is performed when a lexicographer finishes his work on an entry (changing the status) or on demand (using 'validation' button). Conclusions and future work This presentation describes a valence dictionary of Polish Walenty from the point of view of accessing and elaborating it via Internet browser. The dictionary is still under development, hence the dedicated tool Slowal is focused on editing functionalities rather than presentation. It is intended to maximise cohesion, minimise error rate, and to make the lexicographers' work as easy as possible. Therefore, the future work will focus on increasing the readability of presentation in Slowal. In the nearest future we also plan to add phraseology to semantic layer, i.e., extracting multi-word lemmas from lexicalised arguments and linking them with PLWORDNET multi-word lemmas. The automatic support of this layer based on frame statistics and PLWORDNET is planned as well.
