The scheme was implemented as a new module for a Danish frame tagger and applied to a 90,000-token Danish treebank with ongoing manual revision. In addition to explicit frames, Constraint Grammar rules are used to map free semantic roles on noun dependents without pre-defined frames, using general syntactic-semantic context clues. We discuss the annotation scheme and present a statistical breakdown and linguistic evaluation of the assigned noun frames and adnominal roles in the corpus. Introduction There is a long linguistic tradition of frame and role annotation for verbal predications, rooted in verb sense classifications on the one hand (e.g. Levin 1993) , and the concept of semantic roles (also called thematic or case roles, Fillmore 1968 ) on the other. In a frame-based framework, verb categories and semantic roles are seen as interdependent, and predications are annotated for both, usually involving both valency-bound arguments and free (adverbial) satellites of a given verb. Two crucial resources in the area are FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998 , Ruppenhofer et al. 2010) and PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005 ). The former is more lexicographical in its conception and focuses on a one-by-one exhaustive description of individual frames, the latter offers exhaustive proposition annotation of running corpus sentences, with an eye on applications such as Machine Learning (ML). For Danish, both a FrameNet and a frame tagger (DanGram) have been published (Bick 2011) , but unlike some work on larger languages, e.g. the German Salsa corpus (Rehbein et al. 2012 ), these Danish tools addressed only verbal frames, largely ignoring nominal predications. The work presented here strives to resolve this problem in a three-pronged fashion, with automatic corpus annotation based on (a) systematic derivation of noun frames from verb frames, (b) lexicographical treatment of argument-carrying nouns and (c) free role-mapping rules based on semantic noun classes and syntactic triggers. De-verbal noun frame derivation Rather than define separate frames for nouns, we think that frames have a sufficient level of abstraction to work across not only syntactic, but also morphological/POS variants. We therefore use the frame inventory of the Danish FrameNet, with around 500 categories 1 , as is. For verbs themselves, morphological variation covers participles and gerunds, and allows verbs to fill adjectival or adverbial slots while still retaining their arguments, with parallel constructions in Danish and English, e.g. ). For such compound nouns with a second part ending in -else/ing, we applied the act/event condition to both the second part and the noun as a whole (if tagged). In addition, compounds with semantic class differences between whole and second part were deemed unsafe. In loan words, Danish also allows the Latin equivalent of its native -else/-ing derivation, where -ere verbs correspond to -ion/-ation nouns: adoptere -adoption, approksimere -approksimation. Not least in the scientific domain, these words constitute a sizeable section of the lexicon, and many -ere verbs have been moved into the common domain, taking -else/-ing suffixes and allowing productive prefixation, e.g. afnazificere/-ing [\"denazify\"], detailregulere/-ing [\"regulate in detail\"]. While adding the -ere/-ation derivation to the frametagger did improve coverage, there is a substantical risk of gaps due to irregular stemming, e.g. the phonetically motivated c/k shift in kvalificere -kvalifikation [qualify -qualification], making the method less automatic and more dependent on derivational lexicon entries. Lexicon scheme for nominal frames Apart from proofreading automatic derivational analysis and entering verb stems for irregular -ation nouns, we also introduced the option of entering complete nominal frames into the lexicon from scratch. This solution is obviously much more labour-intensive, but allows the treatment of argumenttaking nouns without any de-verbal morphological clue. Each noun frame entry (FN) lists first the corresponding verb frame and then a slash-separated list of possible semantic role arguments 4 (marked \u00a7) with their slot filler conditions (1-5). We distinguish between primary conditions and secondary, optional subconditions (present in 1-3). Primary conditions are placed before the role concerned, secondary condition after it. The former are syntactic slot conditions (left/genitive position, self and bound preposition lexeme), the latter are categorial The Danish FrameNet foresees about 35 argument-capable roles and an additional 15 satellite roles conditions concerning semantic class. Form conditions such as 'icl' (non-finite clause) or 'fcl' (finite clause) can be used both instead of a preposition condition or as a subcondition on the argument of the preposition (4). We created a new module for the DanGram Framtagger identifying nominal frames by trying to match conditions on argument slots and then assigning the corresponding semantic roles and tagging instantiated verb frames on the noun in question. If an NP has a human genitive dependent, agent role ( \u00a7AG) will be used as a fall-back if no genitive condition with another role is found the lexical frame entries for the noun itself or, if relevant, its derivational verbal base. A special case of deverbal nouns are cases, where the noun denotes not the predicating core of the frame (as in -else/ing), but rather one of the arguments, usually the subject. Even without a realized predicator, such nouns still evoke their frame and will take genitive or preposition arguments representing other roles in the frame, as in the hosting-frame for vaert, where the word itself is the agent (self \u00a7AG), while events and beneficiaries can be added as genitive [gen] or with the preposition for: 1. vaert -FN:socializeO/self \u00a7AG/for,gen \u00a7BEN'H/for,gen \u00a7EV'occ [host for/to sb/an event] 4 Free role mapping As for verbs, some PP dependents of nouns are not valency-bound by their head (arguments), but simple free satellites (adjuncts), with a low selection preference for a specific noun or frame. Thus, the majority of nouns can take a location complement, and most nouns with a deverbal component allow time complements. In these cases, a semantic role can be assigned to the adjunct complement, but no specific frame will be triggered by doing so, leaving the head noun untagged. Consider the following examples from our corpus, all of which contain an \u00a7EXT (extension) role complement mediated by the preposition p\u00e5: 1. nedskaeringer p\u00e5 750 millioner [cuts amounting to 750 million] -frame: decrease 2. h\u00e5ndteringsbel\u00f8b p\u00e5 50 kroner [a handling fee of 50 crowns] -compound, frame: cost 3. fedtindhold p\u00e5 0,5% [a fat content of 0.5%] 4. ikke s\u00e5 interessant efter 11 bind p\u00e5 2 timer [not so interesting after 11 volumes in 2 hours]implied frame: read These cases exhibit a cline from strongest-bound complement (1) to weakest-bound complement (4). Thus, in (1) the decrease-frame is recoverable from a verbal template skaere ned p\u00e5, which inherently implies a degree/extension of \"cutting down\". In (2), no verb is recoverable, but compound analysis reveals a second part noun bel\u00f8b [amount] , that has a frame listed in the lexicon, and a semantic class implying measurability. The second part of the compound (3), on the other hand (indhold [content]), evokes the containing frame, that only loosely implies degree, and only in connection with the first part (fedt [fat]). In (4), finally, the real predication (frame read) is elliptic, and only implied by a potential reading object (bind [volumes] ). For ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), our corpus annotation task can rely on lexicon information, once the frame-carrying lexeme is identified. For (3) and ( 4 ), however, role mapping has to be performed without identifying a frame first. For this, we use Constraint Grammar mapping rules relying on the semantic class of the role carrier and its head preposition. Even where no semantic class is available, the degree/extension role can often be inferred from modifiers (numbers) or even hinted at by inflexion (plural), as long as the trigger-preposition (p\u00e5) is present and linked to a noun. The rule below maps the EXT role (extension) on nouns of class <unit> 5 , if they have the right preposition as parent (p) and a noun LINKed as grandparent, and if the immediate left context (-1) is either a numeral (NUM) or a fraction word (NUM-FRACT) preceded (-1) by a number or the article \"en\". MAP ( \u00a7EXT) TARGET N-UNIT (p (\"p\u00e5\" PRP) LINK p N) ((-1 NUM) OR (-1 NUM-FRACT LINK -1 NUM OR (\"en\"))) ; Results Our noun frame scheme and annotator module were developed as part of a larger Propbank project for Danish, and applied to a 87,000-token treebank automatically pre-annotated with morphosyntactic tags, (ambiguous) semantic class potential for nouns and dependency links. The corpus is based on the larger, sentence-randomized Korpus2010 (Asmussen 2015) and covers a variety of both printed, electronically published and described sources, among them national newspapers (15%) and magazines (58%), blogs (8.5%), chat fora (2.5%), parliamentary speeches (10.5%) and various Internet sources (6%), such as a recipe website. While the Propbank is subject to revision at all levels of annotation, and will contain full mark-up for all verbal frames, we are here only concerned with noun frames and their distribution. Our method tagged 9.6% (1342) of the about 15,000 nouns in the corpus as frame carriers, and identified 4477 ad-nominal roles. Of these, about 30% were linked to (and identified through) a noun frame, while the remaining 70% were assigned by free mapping rules. About half (2300) of the adnominal role carriers were themselves nouns, 26% were clauses (especially relative clauses), and 13% names. Predictably, we found a clear tendency for some roles to be frame-projected arguments (ACT, RES, CAU, TH, PAT) while others were mostly identified by free mapping rules (ATR, ID, LOC, ORI, EXT). Note that the rule uses not the /unit/ tag itself, but a set, N-UNIT, which has been defined elsewhere in the grammar and allows the inclusion of other classes that unit itself, such as currency or containers, or even the addition of individual words, like the English-inspired fod [foot], which is not an ordinary Danish unit The identified noun frames covered 741 different lexemes, amounting to a type/token ratio of about 1:2, indicating a higher lexeme spread than for verbs (type/token ratio of 1:8), probably due to the fact that both frequent and infrequent verbs are frame carriers, while many frequent nouns are not. All in all, 255 different frames were found, covering about half the frame inventory in the Danish FrameNet. Table 2 lists the most frequent noun frames, and for each of them, the three most frequent lexeme realisation. As can be seen, some frames are dominated by a single lexeme, while others have a more even lexeme spread. be_part and run_obj are examples of frames, where the carrier token often is itself a frame participant (i.e. deserving a role tag in its own frame), but most carrier words (and not only the 50% or so of verb-derived -else/ing words) function as predicators for their frame and can only carry role tags for a higher-level, containing frame.  Since manual revision of the noun frames is work in progress, it is difficult to say how many frames we missed, but inspection indicates that 20% of the ad-nominal roles assigned by free mapping were in fact arguments rather than satellites,warranting a frame tag on their head noun. Given that certain roles are more likely to be arguments than others, these could be flagged for prioritized inspection, if linked to a frameless head. Another potential indicator for false-negatives are non-transparent nouns (i.e. excluding Danish equivalents of \"kind [of]\", \"lot [of]\", \"handful\" etc.) that did not receive any role-tag. A low figure of 5% for this category indicates a good coverage for our method, not least because every second of such nouns is a simple genitive modifying a non-deverbal noun, with a very low chance of being a role carrier. Conclusions and outlook We have shown how a combined method of verbo-nominal derivation, lexical argument-slotfiller information and ontology-based role mapping rules can be used to extend annotation of a Danish Propbank from verbal to nominal frames with a reasonable coverage. Our automatic annotation allows lexeme-and category-based statistics amenable to linguistic information and conducive to an informed prioritization of future manual revision work. Thus, a first layer of noun frame annotation will be available in the upcoming 2017 release of the Danish Propbank.",
