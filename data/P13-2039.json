Introduction Consumers rely increasingly on user-generated online reviews to make purchase decisions. Positive opinions can result in significant financial gains. This gives rise to deceptive opinion spam (Ott et al., 2011; Jindal et al., 2008) , fake reviews written to sound authentic and deliberately mislead readers. Previous research has shown that humans have difficulty distinguishing fake from truthful reviews, operating for the most part at chance (Ott et al., 2011 ). Consider, for example, the following two hotel reviews. One is truthful and the other is deceptive 1 : 1. My husband and I stayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago. We were very pleased with the accommodations and enjoyed the service every minute of it! The bedrooms are immaculate, and the linens are very soft. We also appreciated the free wifi, as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in Chicago. The bathroom was quite spacious, and I loved the smell of the shampoo they provided. Their service was amazing, 1 The first example is a deceptive review. and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool. I would recommend staying here to anyone. 2. We stayed at the Sheraton by Navy Pier the first weekend of November. The view from both rooms was spectacular (as you can tell from the picture attached). They also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in made us all feel very special. The hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. so we walked, trolleyed, and cabbed all around the area. We ate the breakfast buffet on both mornings and thought it was pretty good. The eggs were a little runny. Our six year old ate free and our two eleven year old were $14 (instead of the adult $20). The rooms were clean, the concierge and reception staff were both friendly and helpful...we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we stay in Chicago next time. Because of the difficulty of recognizing deceptive opinions, there has been a widespread and growing interest in developing automatic, usually learningbased methods to help users identify deceptive reviews (Ott et al., 2011; Jindal et al., 2008; Jindal et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011) . The state-of-the-art approach treats the task of spam detection as a text categorization problem and was first introduced by Jindal and Liu (2009) who trained a supervised classifier to distinguish duplicated reviews (assumed deceptive) from original ones (assumed truthful). Since then, many supervised approaches have been proposed for spam detection. Ott et al. (2011) employed standard word and part-of-speech (POS) n-gram features for supervised learning and built a gold \u2212 standard opinion dataset of 800 reviews. Lim et al. (2010) proposed the inclusion of user behaviorbased features and found that behavior abnormalities of reviewers could predict spammers, without using any textual features. Li et al. (2011) carefully explored review-related features based on content and sentiment, training a semi-supervised classifier for opinion spam detection. However, the disadvantages of standard supervised learning methods are obvious. First, they do not generally provide readers with a clear probabilistic pre-diction of how likely a review is to be deceptive vs. truthful. Furthermore, identifying features that provide direct evidence against deceptive reviews is always a hard problem. LDA topic models (Blei et al., 2003) have widely been used for their ability to model latent topics in document collection. In LDA, each document is presented as a mixture distribution of topics and each topic is presented as a mixture distribution of words. Researchers also integrated different levels of information into LDA topic models to model the specific knowledge that they are interested in, such as user-specific information (Rosen-zvi et al., 2006) , document-specific information (Li et al., 2010) and time-specific information (Diao et al., 2012) . Ramage et al. (2009) developed a Labeled LDA model to define a oneto-one correspondence between LDA latent topics and tags. Chemudugunta et al. (2008) illustrated that by considering background information and document-specific information, we can largely improve the performance of topic modeling. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach called TopicSpam for deceptive review detection. Our approach, which is a variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) , aims to detect the subtle differences between the topic-word distributions of deceptive reviews vs. truthful ones. In addition, our model can give a clear probabilistic prediction on how likely a review should be treated as deceptive or truthful. Performance is tested on dataset from Ott et al.(2011) that contains 800 reviews of 20 Chicago hotels. Our model achieves more than 94% accuracy on that dataset. TopicSpam We are presented with four subsets of hotel reviews, M = {M i } i=4 i=1 , representing deceptive train, truthf ul train, deceptive test and truthf ul test data, respectively. Each review r is comprised of a number of words r = {w t } t=nr t=1 . Input for the TopicSpam algorithm is the datasets M ; output is the label (deceptive, truthful) for each review in M 3 and M 4 . V denotes vocabulary size. Details of TopicSpam In TopicSpam, each document is modeled as a bag of words, which are assumed to be generated from a mixture of latent topics. Each word is associated with a latent variable that specifies \u2022 For a training review in r 2j \u2208 M 2 , words are originated from one of the three different topics: \u03c6 B , \u03c6 H j and \u03c6 T . \u2022 For a test review in r mj \u2208 M m , m = 3, 4, words are originated from one of the four different topics: \u03c6 B , \u03c6 H j \u03c6 D and \u03c6 T . The generation process of TopicSpam is shown in Figure 1 and the corresponding graphical model is illustrated in Figure 2 . We use \u03bb = (\u03bb G , \u03bb H i , \u03bb D , \u03bb T ) to represent the asymmetric priors for topic-word distribution generation. In our experiments, we set \u03bb G = 0.1, and \u03bb H i = \u03bb D = \u03bb T = 0.01. The intuition for the asymmetric priors is that there should be more words assigned to the background topic. \u03b3 = [\u03b3 B , \u03b3 H i , \u03b3 D , \u03b3 T ] denotes the priors for the document-level topic distribution in the LDA model. We set \u03b3 B = 2 and \u03b3 T = \u03b3 D = \u03b3 H i = 1, reflecting the intuition that more words in each document should cover the background topic. Inference We adopt the collapsed Gibbs sampling strategy to infer the latent parameters in TopicSpam. In Gibbs sampling, for each word w in review r, we need to calculate P (z w |w, z \u2212w , \u03b3, \u03bb) in each iteration, where z \u2212w denotes the topic assignments for all words except that of the current word z w . 1. sample \u03c6 G \u223c Dir(\u03bb G ) 2. sample \u03c6 D \u223c Dir(\u03bb D ) 3. sample \u03c6 T \u223c Dir(\u03bb T ) 4. for each hotel j \u2208 [1, N ]: sample \u03c6 H j \u223c \u03bb H 5. for each review r if i=1: sample \u03b8 r \u223c Dir(\u03b3 B , \u03b3 H j , \u03b3 D ) if i=2: sample \u03b8 r \u223c Dir(\u03b3 B , \u03b3 H j , \u03b3 T ) if i=3: sample \u03b8 r \u223c Dir(\u03b3 B , \u03b3 H j , \u03b3 D , \u03b3 T ) if i=4: sample \u03b8 r \u223c Dir(\u03b3 B , \u03b3 H j , \u03b3 D , \u03b3 T ) for each word w in R sample z \u223c \u03b8 r sample w \u223c \u03c6 z P (z w = m|z \u2212w , i, j, \u03b3, \u03bb) N m r + \u03b3 m m (N m r + \u03b3 m ) \u2022 E w m + \u03bb m V w E w m + V \u03bb m (1) where N m r denotes the number of times that topic m appears in current review r and E w m denotes the number of times that word w is assigned to topic m. After each sampling iteration, the latent parameters can be estimated using the following formulas: \u03b8 m r = N m r + \u03b3 m m (N m r + \u03b3 m ) \u03c6 (w) m = E w m + \u03bb m w E w m + V \u03bb m (2) Labeling the Test Data For each review r in the test data, let N D r denote the number of words generated from the deceptive topic and N T r , the number of words generated from the truthful topic. The decision for whether a review is deceptive or truthful is made as follows: \u2022 if N D r > N T r , r is deceptive. \u2022 if N D r < N T r , r is truthful. \u2022 if N D r = N T r , it is hard to decide. Let P(D) denote the probability that r is deceptive and P(T) denote the probability that r is truthful. P (D) = N D r N D r + N T r P (T ) = N T r N D r + N T r (3) 3 Experiments System Description Our experiments are conducted on the dataset from Ott et al.(2011) , which contains reviews of the 20 most popular hotels on TripAdvisor in the Chicago areas. There are 20 truthful and 20 deceptive reviews for each of the chosen hotels (800 reviews total). Deceptive reviews are gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk 2 . In our experiments, we adopt the same 5-fold cross-validation strategy as in Ott et al., using the same data partitions. Words are stemmed using PorterStemmer 3 . Baselines We employ a number of techniques as baselines: TopicTD: A topic-modeling approach that only considers two topics: deceptive and truthful. Words in deceptive train are all generated from the deceptive topic and words in truthf ul train are generated from the truthful topic. Test documents are presented with a mixture of the deceptive and truthful topics. TopicTDB: A topic-modeling approach that only considers background, deceptive and truthful information. SVM-Unigram: Using SVMlight (Joachims, 1999) to train linear SVM models on unigram features. SVM-Bigram: Using SVMlight (Joachims, 1999) to train linear SVM models on bigram features. SVM-Unigram-Removal1: In SVM-Unigram-Removal, we first train TopicSpam. Then words generated from hotel-specific topics are removed. We use the remaining words as features in SVMlight. SVM-Unigram-Removal2: Same as SVM-Unigram-removal-1 but removing all background words and hotel-specific words. Experimental results are shown in Table 1 4 . As we can see, the accuracy of TopicSpam is 0.948, outperforming TopicTD by 6.4%. This illustrates the effectiveness of modeling background and hotel-specific information for the opinion spam detection problem. We also see that Top-icSpam slightly outperforms TopicTDB, which is worse than other baselines. This can be explained as follows: for example, word \"my\" has large probability to be generated from the background topic. However it can also be generated by deceptive topic occasionaly but can hardly be generated from the truthful topic. So the removal of these words results in the loss of useful information, and leads to low accuracy rate. Our topic-modeling approach uses word frequency as features and does not involve any feature selection process. Here we present the results of the sample reviews from Section 1. Stop words are labeled in black, background topics (B) in blue, hotel specific topics (H) in orange, deceptive topics (D) in red and truthful topic (T) in green. 1.
