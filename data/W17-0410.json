Three possible annotation schemas are discussed, among which separating existential clauses from copular clauses would be theoretically most sound but would need too much manual labor and could possibly yield inconcistent annotation. Therefore, a solution has been adapted which separates existential clauses consisting only of subject and (copular) verb olema be from all other olema-clauses. Introduction This paper discusses the annotation problems and research questions that came up during the annotation of Estonian copular sentences while developing Estonian Universal Dependencies treebank, especially while converting it from version 1 of UD annotation guidelines to version 2. Copular clauses are a sentence type in which the contentful predicate is not a verb, but falls into some other category. In some languages there is no verbal element at all in these clauses; in other languages there is a verbal copula joining the subject and the non-verbal element (Mikkelsen, 2011 (Mikkelsen, , p. 1805)) . In Estonian, there is mainly one verb, namely olema 'be', that functions as copula in copular clauses. Estonian descriptive grammar (Erelt et al., 1993) uses the term copular verb (Est 'k\u00f6ide') only for describing sentences with subject complements, stating that in such sentences the verb olema has only grammatical features of a predicate (time, mode, person) . Also, the copula olema is semantically empty if used alone and it can not have any other dependents than non-verbal predicate. At the same time, verb olema is the most frequent verb of Estonian language which can also function as auxiliary verb in compound tenses, be part of phrasal verbs, and may occur in existential, possessor or cognizer sentences. As the descriptive grammar of Estonian (Erelt et al., 1993) lacks more detailed treatment of copular sentences, the label \"copula\" has not been introduced into original Estonian Dependency Treebank (EDT) (Muischnek et al., 2014) . In copular clauses olema is annotated as the root of the clause and other components of the sentence depend on it; that is also the case if the sentence contains a subject complement. As subject complements have a special label PRD (predicative) in EDT, such sentences can be easily searched. Estonian treebank for UD v1.3 has been generated automatically from EDT using transfer rules. The guidelines for UD v1 implied that subject complements serve as roots in copular clauses. This analysis of copula constructions, according to UD v1 guidelines, extended to adpositional phrases and oblique nominals as long as they have a predicative function. By contrast, temporal and locative modifiers were treated as dependents on the existential verb 'be'. Therefore, while converting EDT to UD v1, sentences with subject complements were relatively easily transferred to sentences with copular tree structure (Muischnek et al., 2016) . However, oblique nominals and adpositional phrases were not annotated as instances of nonverbal predication. Since UD v 2.0 assumes a more general annotation scheme for copular sentences, we faced several conversion problems and also linguistic questions. This paper provides insights into these research questions, gives an overview how copular clauses are annotated in some UD v2 treebanks for some other languages (Finnish, German, English) and describes what are the options for annotating Estonian sentences. In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 we give a short account of UD v2 guidelines for annotating copular clauses and show how these constructions are annotated in some UD v2 treebanks for Finnish, German and English. Section 3 is dedicated to copular constructions in Estonian language and Estonian UD versions 1 and 2. Some conclusions are drawn in Section 4. UD annotation guidelines for nonverbal predication According to the UD annotation scheme version 1, copular constructions are to be annotated differently from other clause types, analysing the predicative element as root and if there is an overt linking verb present, it should be attached to this nonverbal predicate as copula. The copula relation is restricted to function words whose sole function is to link a non-verbal predicate to its subject and which does not add any meaning other than grammaticalised TAME categories. Such an analysis is motivated by the fact that many languages often or always lack an overt copula, so annotation would be cross-linguistically consistent 1 . Version 2 of UD annotation guidelines extend the set of constructions that should be annotated as instances of nonverbal predication, defining six categories of nonverbal predication, namely those of equation, attribution, location, possession, benefaction and existence 2 . In order to get better overview of practical annotation of copular constructions cross-linguistically, we studied the v2 versions of UD treebanks of Finnish, which is the most closely related language to Estonian present in UD, and also German and English. As the language-independent annotation guidelines for UD version 2 were published in the very end of last year, there are no languagespecific guidelines published yet. So we had to rely on treebank queries in order to gain information about annotating copular and related constructions in the afforementioned languages. We queried UD v2 treebanks using the SETS treebank search maintained by the University of Turku 3 . There are two UD treebanks for Finnish: the Finnish UD treebank, based on Turku Dependency Treebank, and Finnish-FTB (FinnTreeBank). In Finnish UD v2 treebank, clauses with olla 'be' are mostly regarded as instances of nonverbal predication, annotating olla as copula (1), among them also possessive clauses (2). However, if the clause contains only subject besides some form of olla, olla is annotated as root (3). In Finnish FTB v2 treebank more clause types are annotated with olla as root, e.g. possessive clause (4) and clause containing predicative adverbial (5). It seems that annotation of copular constructions in Finnish FTB resembles that in version 1 of Estonian UD only subject complements are annotated as roots in copular constructions. In the UD v2 treebank of German, sentences with subject complement are annotated as instances of nonverbal predication ( 6 ) and other instances of sein and werden 'be' seem to be annotated as main verbs, not copulas ( 7 ). ( There are four English UD treebanks, but we queried only the largest of them, the English Web Treebank. It seems that predicative (e.g. Fig. 1 ) and locative (Fig. 2 ) constructions are analysed as instances of non-verbal predication, whereas existential clauses (Fig. 3 ) are not.   As the above discussion illustrates, annotation of copular constructions varies across different languages and also across different treebanks. Having better documentation for v2 treebanks would facilitate better understanding of these differences. It would also be helpful for those teams which are still working on v2 of their treebanks to make more informed decisions. Copular and existential constructions in Estonian In Estonian, copular verb can not be omitted in normal writing or speech. However, there are some exceptions. First, copula is often omitted in headlines like (8). (8) Valitsus Government otsustusv\u00f5imetu indecisive 'Government is indecisive.' And due to time pressure, copula, but also other verbs, can be omitted in online communication (9). ( 9 ) Ma I nii so kurb sad 'I am so sad.' As a sidenote, although ellipsis of verb olema is rare in Estonian, it is still more frequent than in Finnish (Kehayov, 2008) . The annotation guidelines for version 2 of Universal Dependencies define six categories of nonverbal predication that can be found crosslinguistically (with or without a copula), namely equation (aka identification), attribution, location, possession, benefaction and existence. As for Estonian, constructions expressing equation (10a), attribution (10b), location (10c), possession (10d), benefaction (10e) or existence (10f) are all coded using verb olema. In addition to the afforementioned clause types, there are also cognizer clauses (10g) that can be viewed as a subtype or metaphorical extension of the possessive clause type. Perhaps also quantification clause (10h) should be mentioned as a separate type. (10) a. Further in this section we will discuss three possible ways to annotate Estonian clauses containing the (copular) verb olema. Among the constructions (10 a-h), existential clauses (f) are exceptional as they can consist also only of subject and some form of verb olema. In our opinion, such construction can not be annotated as an instance of nonverbal predication as there is no possible predicate except the verb olema. As for the sake of consistency, all existential clauses should be annotated in the same way, i.e. as instances of verbal predication, not nonverbal, we would have to distinguish existential constructions from all other olema-clauses. In what follows in this Section, we will study if this solution can be applied while annotating real corpus sentences. For that we have to find out, if and how existential clauses can be identified. We start with investigating the linguistic features of the existential clause type on the background of main clause types in Estonian. Subsection 3.1 presents the linguistic features of Estonian existential constructions. Subsection 3.2 gives overview of constructions annotated as instances of nonverbal predication in version 1 of Estonian UD treebank. In subsection 3.3 we discuss three possibilities for annotating olema-clauses in Estonian UD v2 and conclude the section with adopting a compromise solution. Existential clauses in Estonian Characteristic features of Estonian existential clauses include the possibility of partitive subject (the default case of Estonian subject is nominative) and inverted word order (subject comes after verb), but existential clauses share these features with possessive clauses and also some other minor clause types. In order to understand the problem, we start with a small overview of main clause types in Estonian, explain how olema-clauses are distributed among those clause types, paying special attention to the existential clause type. Descriptive grammars of Estonian (Erelt et al., 1993, pp. 14-15) and (Erelt, 2003, pp. 43-46) distinguish between three main clause types, depending on whether syntactic subject, semantic macrorole of actor and clause topic (theme) overlap, i.e. are coded by the same nominal. In socalled normal clauses, the same nominal functions as subject, actor and topic; in possessor-cognizer clauses, the possessed or cognized entity is both subject and topic, but not actor, which in turn denotes the possessor or cognizer. Subject noun denotes actor in existential clauses, but is rhematic. Possessor-cognizer and existential clauses are regarded as marked clause types, also termed inverted clauses (Erelt, 2003, pp. 93-55) , as they have inverted word order in pragmatically neutral sentences -XVS instead of SVX, otherwise typical for \"ordinary\" Estonian sentences. Subjects of these marked clause types can be in partitive case form, while nominative is the unmarked and statistically dominant subject case. A few remarks about the possible case forms of subject in Estonian are in place here. Estonian descriptive grammars (Erelt et al., 1993, p. 15) and (Erelt, 2013, p. 36) state that existential and possessive clauses differ from other clause types in the possibility of subject case alternation: the subject is mostly in partitive case form in negative sentences ( 12 ), ( 14 ) and can be in partitive case form also in affirmative sentences (11),(13) if the referent of the subject noun is quantitatively unbounded. ( Statistically, negation is the most powerful predictor of partitive subject (Miestamo, 2014) . Of the clause types defined in UD documentation, existential clauses share the property of casealternating subject with possessive clauses, but partitive subject is much less frequent in cognizer clauses, which can otherwise be seen as a constructional extension of the possessive clause. Partitive subject is the only option in quantification clause, regardless of its polarity, and in negative possessive clause. Existential clauses differ from other marked clause types as they can consist also of subject only, besides the verb olema; in this case the clause merely states or negates the existence of an entity denoted by subject (15). There is also a special periphrastic verb form olema olemas (be be-INE) used for stating that something exists ( 16 ). Nonverbal predication in version 1 of Estonian UD treebank According to the first version of Universal Dependencies' guidelines, copular clauses consisting of a noun or an adjective, which takes a single argument with the subject relation were to be analysed as instances of nonverbal predication. The copula verb (if present) was attached to the predicate with the \"cop\" relation. This analysis of copula constructions was extended to adpositional phrases and oblique nominals as long as they had a predicative function. By contrast, temporal and locative modifiers were to be treated as dependents on the existential verb 'be'. So clauses containing some copular verb were to be divided between categories of verbal and nonverbal predication. In version 1 of Estonian UD treebank, only sentences containing verb olema and subject complement in nominative or partitive case form were annotated as instances of nonverbal predication (17). This was partly motivated by the fact that subject complements were already annotated using a special dependency relation (PRD) in our original treebank, the Estonian Dependency Treebank. All other copular clauses were annotated as instances of verbal predication, annotating form of verb olema as root ( 18 ). ( Among the Estonian copular constructions listed in the beginning of Section 3, existential constructions only stating or negating the existence of an entity expressed by subject and consisting only of verb olema and its subject (15) pose a problem for UD v2 annotation scheme. We are on the opinion that they can not be analysed as examples of nonverbal predication as one can not label subject as a predicate, so in these sentences verb form of olema 'be' has to be annotated as root, not as copula. Thus we have three basic options for annotating copular constructions in Estonian UD v2: always annotate olema as copula; separate clauses consisting of verb olema and its subject from all other olema-clauses and, as third option, try to separate existential clauses from other olema-clauses. The fourth possible solution would be to stick to the solution we had in version 1 of Estonian UD, namely annotate only subject complements, i.e. nouns and adjectives in nominative or partitive case form as non-verbal predicates, but as this solution would violate the guidelines for UD version 2, we will not discuss it further. We will take a closer look at the first three afforementioned options one by one. for building dependency treebanks (Nivre et al., 2016) . Its version 2, published only a few months ago, introduced a major change concerning annotating nonverbal predication: the repertoire of clauses that should be treated as examples of nonverbal predication was considerably broadened. Often real corpus data is a challenge even for well-premeditated theoretical constructs; even more so if this corpus data comes in more than 50 languages. So it should not be a surprise that there are still some open issues or inconsistencies. This article tackled the problems concerning defining and annotating copular constructions in Estonian, with some brief cross-linguistic comparison. We came forward with three possible annotation schemas, among which separating existential clauses from copular clauses would be theoretically most sound but would need too much manual labor and would possibly result in inconcistent annotation. So we will adapt the solution that, somewhat artificially, separates existential clauses consisting only of subject and (copular) verb olema from all other olema-clauses. It seems that delimiting and annotating nonverbal predication and related phenomena is not entirely consistent cross-linguistically. In this article we had a look at a very small set of languages, but the analysis of nonverbal predication and copular constructions from a cross-linguistic (or cross-treebank) perspective deserves in-depth study. For the sake of better understanding the exact annotation of linguistic phenomena in different languages, thorough documentation of principles and decisions underlying the annotation would be beneficial. As for Estonian UD treebank, the solution that at the first glance seemed most correct from the linguistic point of view, is (almost) impossible to achieve even by manual annotation.

Annotate all olema-clauses as instances of nonverbal predication This would be the most straightforward solution from the point of view of UD v1 to v2 conversion process. The main drawback would be having to annotate subjects as predicates in clauses consisting only of verb olema and its subject (Fig. 4 ). Figure 4 : A subject as a root, annotation of the sentence (15). Distinguishing subject-only clauses and other olema-clauses Second possible option would be to distinguish two separate classes of olema-clauses basing on simple syntactic criterion: if the sentence consists only of some form of olema or periphrastic verb olemas olema and its subject, then (olemas) olema is annotated as root. All other sentences are annotated as instances of nonverbal predication. The distinction would be easy to make and the main drawback would be that existential sentences like (15) and ( 19 ) get different syntactic structures, which can be regarded as an inconsistent solution. Eile Yesterday oli was kontsert, concert-PL kus where loeti read-IMPS ka also luuletusi. poem-PL.PRT 'There was a concert yesterday where poems were also chanted.' Separate existentials and other olema-clauses For the sake of consistency, all existential constructions should be annotated the same way, irrelevant whether they consist only of subject and verb or do they have more syntactic participants. This approach, although theoretically correct in our opinion, is not easy to apply in annotation practice. As already described in subsection 3.1, Estonian existential clauses are defined as those, which subject is in partitive case in negative clauses and can be in partitive case also in affirmative clauses. In a pragmatically neutral affirmative clause, word order distinguishes between locative (20) and existential clauses (21). Negative variants of these clauses show the distinction -subject is in nominative case form in locative clause ( 22 ) and in partitive case form in existential clause (23). The example sentences are of course simplifications, especially with regard to word order; in the corpus sentences the word order does not distinguish existential clauses as it is determined mostly by information structure and depends heavily on larger textual context. dog-PRT 'There is no dog in the garden.' So, if we would like to apply this solution, it would mean that human annotators have to go over all affirmative clauses that could possibly be existential clauses and make the distinction basing on their intuitions about the probable subject case in the negative counterpant of the affirmative clause under consideration -which means that there has to be more than one annotator for every clause. But Peep Nemvalts (2000) , who has analysed Estonian existential sentences, comparing them with the same phenomenon in other languages, has concluded that it is impossible to distinguish Estonian existential sentences basing on formal criteria. Therefore, after considering all possible solutions for distinguishing copular and non-copular usages of olema 'be', we had to make a compromise and adopt the second possible solution, i.e. distinguish subject-only clauses and other olemaclauses. In resulting annotated treebank, existential clauses are divided between instances of verbal and non-verbal predication, which can be regarded as a drawback. On the other hand, the resulting annotation is consistent, which is a clear advantage. Conclusion Universal Dependencies is planned to offer language-typologically relevant and crosslinguistically consistent annotation guidelines",
