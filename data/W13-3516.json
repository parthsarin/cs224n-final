    "article": "Large-scale linguistically annotated corpora have played a crucial role in advancing the state of the art of key natural language technologies such as syntactic, semantic and discourse analyzers, and they serve as training data as well as evaluation benchmarks. Up till now, however, most of the evaluation has been done on monolithic corpora such as the Penn Treebank, the Proposition Bank. As a result, it is still unclear how the state-of-the-art analyzers perform in general on data from a variety of genres or domains. The completion of the OntoNotes corpus, a large-scale, multi-genre, multilingual corpus manually annotated with syntactic, semantic and discourse information, makes it possible to perform such an evaluation. This paper presents an analysis of the performance of publicly available, state-of-the-art tools on all layers and languages in the OntoNotes v5.0 corpus. This should set the benchmark for future development of various NLP components in syntax and semantics, and possibly encourage research towards an integrated system that makes use of the various layers jointly to improve overall performance. Introduction Roughly a million words of text from the Wall Street Journal newswire (WSJ), circa 1989, has had a significant impact on research in the language processing community -especially those in the area of syntax and (shallow) semantics, the reason for this being the seminal impact of the Penn Treebank project which first selected this text for annotation. Taking advantage of a solid syntactic foundation, later researchers who wanted to annotate semantic phenomena on a relatively large scale, also used it as the basis of their annotation. For example the Proposition Bank (Palmer et al., 2005) , BBN Name Entity and Pronoun coreference corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005) , the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008) , and many other annotation projects, all annotate the same underlying body of text. It was also converted to dependency structures and other syntactic formalisms such as CCG (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002) and LTAG (Shen et al., 2008) , thereby creating an even bigger impact through these additional syntactic resources. The most recent one of these efforts is the OntoNotes corpus (Weischedel et al., 2011) . However, unlike the previous extensions of the Treebank, in addition to using roughly a third of the same WSJ subcorpus, OntoNotes also added several other genres, and covers two other languages -Chinese and Arabic: portions of the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) and the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri and Bies, 2004) have been used to sample the genre of text that they represent. One of the current hurdles in language processing is the problem of domain, or genre adaptation. Although genre or domain are popular terms, their definitions are still vague. In OntoNotes, \"genre\" means a type of source -newswire (NW), broadcast news (BN), broadcast conversation (BC), magazine (MZ), telephone conversation (TC), web data (WB) or pivot text (PT). Changes in the entity and event profiles across source types, and even in the same source over a time duration, as explicitly expressed by surface lexical forms, usually account for a lot of the decrease in performance of models trained on one source and tested on another, usually because these are the salient cues that are relied upon by statistical models. Large-scale corpora annotated with multiple layers of linguistic information exist in various languages, but they typically consist of a single source or collection. The Brown corpus, which consists of multiple genres, have been usually used to investigate issues of genres of sensitivity, but it is relatively small and does not include any infor- 300K Table 1 : Coverage for each layer in the OntoNotes v5.0 corpus, by number of documents, words, and some other attributes. The numbers in parenthesis are the total number of parts in the documents. mal genres such as web data. Very seldom has it been the case that the exact same phenomena have been annotated on a broad cross-section of the same language before OntoNotes. The OntoNotes corpus thus provides an opportunity for studying the genre effect on different syntactic, semantic and discourse analyzers. Parts of the OntoNotes Corpus have been used for various shared tasks organized by the language processing community. The word sense layer was the subject of prediction in two SemEval-2007 tasks, and the coreference layer was the subject of prediction in the SemEval-2010 2 (Recasens et al., 2010) , CoNLL-2011 and 2012 shared tasks (Pradhan et al., 2011; Pradhan et al., 2012) . The CoNLL-2012 shared task provided predicted information to the participants, however, that did not include a few layers such as the named entities for Chinese and Arabic, propositions for Arabic, and for better comparison of the English data with the CoNLL-2011 task, a smaller OntoNotes v4.0 portion of the English parse and propositions was used for training. This paper is a first attempt at presenting a coherent high-level picture of the performance of various publicly available state-of-the-art tools on all the layers of OntoNotes in all three languages, so as to pave the way for further explorations in the area of syntax and semantics processing. The possible avenues for exploratory studies on various fronts are enormous. However, given space considerations, in this paper, we will restrict our presentation of the performance on all layers of annotation in the data by using a stratified cross-section of the corpus for training, development, and testing. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the OntoNotes corpus. Section 3 explains the parameters of the evaluation and the various underlying assumptions. Section 4 presents the experimental results and discussion, and Section 5 concludes the paper. OntoNotes Corpus The OntoNotes project has created a large-scale corpus of accurate and integrated annotation of multiple layers of syntactic, semantic and discourse information in text. The English language portion comprises roughly 1.7M words and Chinese language portion comprises roughly 1M words of newswire, magazine articles, broadcast news, broadcast conversations, web data and conversational speech data 3 . The Arabic portion is smaller, comprising 300K words of newswire articles. This rich, integrated annotation covering many layers aims at facilitating the development of richer, cross-layer models and enabling better automatic semantic analysis. The corpus is tagged with syntactic trees, propositions for most verb and some noun instances, partial verb and noun word senses, coreference, and named entities. Table 1 gives an overview of the number of documents that have been annotated in the entire OntoNotes corpus. Layers of Annotation This section provides a very concise overview of the various layers of annotations in OntoNotes. For a more detailed description, the reader is referred to (Weischedel et al., 2011) and the documentation accompanying the v5.0 4 release. Syntax This represents the layer of syntactic annotation based on revised guidelines for the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Babko-Malaya et al., 2006) , the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) and the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri and Bies, 2004) . There were two updates made to the parse trees as part of the OntoNotes project: i) the introduction of NML phrases, in the English portion, to mark nominal sub-constituents of flat NPs that do not follow the default right-branching structure, and ii) re-tokenization of hyphenated tokens into multiple tokens in English and Chinese. The Arabic Treebank on the other hand was also significantly revised in an effort to increase consistency. Word Sense Coarse-grained word senses are tagged for the most frequent polysemous verbs and nouns, in or-der to maximize token coverage. The word sense granularity is tailored to achieve very high interannotator agreement as demonstrated by Palmer et al. (2007) . These senses are defined in the sense inventory files. In the case of English and Arabic languages, the sense-inventories (and frame files) are defined separately for each part of speech that is realized by the lemma in the text. For Chinese, however the sense inventories (and frame files) are defined per lemma -independent of the part of speech realized in the text. Proposition The propositions in OntoNotes are PropBank-style semantic roles for English, Chinese and Arabic. Most English verbs and few nouns were annotated using the revised guidelines for the English PropBank (Babko-Malaya et al., 2006) as part of the OntoNotes effort. Some enhancements were made to the English PropBank and Treebank to make them synchronize better with each other: one of the outcomes of this effort was that two types of LINKs that represent pragmatic coreference (LINK-PCR) and selectional preferences (LINK-SLC) were added to the original PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) . More details can be found in the addendum to the PropBank guidelines 5 in the OntoNotes v5.0 release. A part of speech agnostic Chinese PropBank (Xue and Palmer, 2009) guidelines were used to annotate most frequent lemmas in Chinese. Many verbs and some nouns and adjectives were annotated using the revised Arabic PropBank guidelines (Palmer et al., 2008; Zaghouani et al., 2010) . Named Entities The corpus was tagged with a set of 18 welldefined proper named entity types that have been tested extensively for inter-annotator agreement by Weischedel and Burnstein (2005) . Coreference This layer captures general anaphoric coreference that covers entities and events not limited to noun phrases or a limited set of entity types (Pradhan et al., 2007) . It considers all pronouns (PRP, PRP$), noun phrases (NP) and heads of verb phrases (VP) as potential mentions. Unlike English, Chinese and Arabic have dropped subjects and objects which were also considered during coreference annotation 6 . The mentions formed by these dropped pronouns total roughly about 11% for both Chinese and Arabic. Coreference is the only document-level phenomenon in OntoNotes. Some of the documents in the corpus -especially the ones in the broadcast conversation, web data, and telephone conversation genre -are very long which prohibited efficient annotation in their entirety. These are split into smaller parts, and each part is considered a separate document for the sake of coreference evaluation. Evaluation Setting Given the scope of the corpus and the multitude of settings one can run evaluations, we had to restrict this study to a relatively focused subset. There has already been evidence of models trained on WSJ doing poorly on non-WSJ data on parses (Gildea, 2001; McClosky et al., 2006) , semantic role labeling (Carreras and M\u00e0rquez, 2005; Pradhan et al., 2008) , word sense (Escudero et al., 2000; ?) , and named entities. The phenomenon of coreference is somewhat of an outlier. The winning system in the CoNLL-2011 shared task was one that was completely rule-based and not directly trained on the OntoNotes corpus. Given this overwhelming evidence, we decided not to focus on potentially complex cross-genre evaluations. Instead, we decided on evaluating the performance on each layer of annotation using an appropriately selected, stratified training, development and test set, so as to facilitate future studies. Training, Development and Test Partitions In this section we will have a brief discussion on the logic behind the partitioning of the data into training, development and test sets. Before we do that, it would help to know that given the range and peculiarities of the layers of annotation and presence of various resource and technical constraints, not all the documents in the corpus are annotated with all the layers of information, and token-centric phenomena (such as word sense and propositions of predicates) were not annotated with 100% coverage. Most of the proposition annotation in English and Arabic is for the verb predicates, with a few nouns annotated in English and some adjectives in Arabic. In Chinese, the selection is part of speech agnostic, and is based on the lemmas that can be considered predicates. Some documents in the corpora are actually snippets from larger documents, and have been annotated for a combination of parse, propositions, word sense and names, but not coreference. If one considers each layer independently, then an ideal partitioning scheme would create a separate partition for each layer such that it maximizes the number of examples that can be extracted for that layer from the corpus. The upside is that one would get as much data there is to train and estimate the performance of each layer across the entire corpus. The downside is that this might cover vari-ous cross sections of the documents in the corpus, and would not provide a clean picture when looking at the collective performance for all the layers. The documents that are annotated with coreference correspond to the intersection of all annotations. These are the documents that have also been annotated with all the other layers of information. The amount of data we can get together in such a test set is big enough to be representative. Therefore, we decided that it would be ideal to choose a portion of these documents as the test collection for all layers. An additional advantage is that it is the exact same test set used in the CoNLL-2012 shared task, and so in a way is already a standard. On the training and development side however, one can still imagine using all possible information for training models for a particular layer, and that is what we decided to do. The training and development data is generated by providing all documents with all available layers of annotation for input, however, the test set is generated by providing as input to the algorithm the set of documents in the corpus that have been annotated for coreference. This algorithm tries to reuse previously established partitions for English, i.e., the WSJ portion. Unfortunately, in the case of Chinese and Arabic, either the historical partitions were not in the selection used for OntoNotes, or were partially overlapping with the ones created using this scheme, and/or had a very small portion of OntoNotes covered in the test set. Therefore, we decided to create a fresh partition for the Chinese and Arabic data. Note, however, that the these test sets also match the ones used in the CoNLL-2012 evaluation. The algorithm for selecting the training, development and test partitions is described on the CoNLL-2012 shared task webpage, along with the list of training, development, and test document IDs 7 . Assumptions Next we had to decide on a set of assumptions to use while designing the experiments to measure the automatic prediction accuracy for each of the layers. Since some of these decisions affect more than one layer of annotation, we will describe these in this section instead of in the section where we discuss the experiment with a particular layer of annotation. Word Segmentation The three languages that we are evaluating are from quite different language families. Arabic has a complex morphology, English has limited morphology, whereas Chinese has very little morphology. English word segmentation amounts to rule-based tokenization, and is close to perfect. In the case of Chinese and Arabic, although the tokenization/segmentation is not as good as English, the accuracies are in the high 90s. Given this we decided to use gold, Treebank segmentation for all languages. In the case of Chinese, the words themselves are lemmas, whereas in English they can be predicted with very high accuracy. For Arabic, by default written text is unvocalised, and lemmatization is a complex process which we considered out of the scope of this study, so we decided to use correct, gold standard lemmas, along with the correct vocalized version of the tokens. Traces and Function Tags Treebank traces have hardly played a role in the mainstream parser and semantic role labeling evaluation. Function tags also have received similar treatment in the parsing community, and though they are important, there is also a significant information overlap between them and the proposition structure provided by the PropBank layer. Whereas in English, most traces represent syntactic phenomena such as movement and raising, in Chinese and Arabic, they can also represent dropped subjects/objects. These subset of traces directly affect the coreference layer, since, unlike English, traces in Chinese and Arabic (*pro* and * respectively) are legitimate targets of mentions and are considered for coreference annotation in OntoNotes. Recovering traces in text is a hard problem, and the most recently reported numbers in literature for Chinese are around a F-score of 50 (Yang and Xue, 2010; Cai et al., 2011) . For Arabic there have not been much studies on recovering these. A study by Gabbard (2010) shows that these can be recovered with an F-score of 55 with automatic parses and roughly 65 using gold parses. Considering the low level of prediction accuracy of these tokens, and their relative low frequency, we decided to consider predicting traces in trees out of the scope of this study. In other words, we removed the manually identified traces and function tags from the Treebanks across all three languages, in all the three -training, development and test partitions. This meant removing any and all dependent annotation in layers such as PropBank and Coreference. In the case of PropBank these are the argument bearing traces, whereas in coreference these are the mentions formed by these elided subjects/objects. Disfluencies One thing that needs to be dealt with in conversational data is the presence of disfluencies (restarts, etc.). In the English parses of the OntoNotes, disfluencies are marked using a special EDITED 8 phrase tag -as was the case for the Switchboard Treebank. Computing the accuracy of identifying disfluencies is also out of the scope of this study. Given the frequency of disfluencies and the performance with which one can identify them automatically, 9 a probable processing pipeline would filter them out before parsing. We decided to remove them using oracle information available in the English Treebank, and the coreference chains were remapped to trees without disfluencies. Owing to various technical constraints, we decided to retain the disfluencies in the Chinese data. Spoken Genre Given the scope of this study, we make another significant assumption. For the spoken genres -BC, BN and TC -we use the manual transcriptions rather than the output of a speech recognizer, as would be the case in real world. The performance on various layers for these genres would therefore be artificially inflated, and should be taken into account while analyzing results. Not many studies have previously reported on syntactic and semantic analysis for spoken genre. Favre et al. ( 2010 ) report the performance on the English subset of an earlier version of OntoNotes. Discourse The corpus contains information on the speaker for broadcast communication, conversation, telephone conversation and writer for the web data. This information provides an important clue for correctly linking anaphoric pronouns with the right antecedents. This information could be automatically deduced, but is also not within the scope of our study. Therefore, we decided to provide gold, instead of predicted, data both during training and testing. Table 2 lists the status of the layers. Experiments In this section, we will report on the experiments carried out using all available data in the training set for training models for a particular layer, and using the CoNLL-2012 test set as the test set. 8 There is another phrase type -EMBED in the telephone conversation genre which is similar to the EDITED phrase type, and sometimes identifies insertions, but sometimes contains logical continuation of phrases by different speakers, so we decided not to remove that from the data. 9 A study by Charniak and Johnson (2001) shows that one can identify and remove edits from transcribed conversational speech with an F-score of about 78, with roughly 95 precision and 67 recall. 10 The predicted part of speech for Arabic are a mapped down version of the richer gold version present in the Treebank Layer English Chinese Arabic Segmentation \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Lemma \u2022 - \u2022 Parse \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 10 Proposition \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Predicate Frame \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Word Sense \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Name Entities \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Coreference \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Speaker \u2022 \u2022 - Number \u2022 \u00d7 \u00d7 Gender \u2022 \u00d7 \u00d7 Table 2 : Status of layers used during prediction of other layers. A \"\u2022\" indicates gold annotation, a \"\u2022\" indicates predicted, a \"\u00d7\" indicates an absence of the predicted layer, and a \"-\" indicates that the layer is not applicable to the language. The predicted annotation layers input to downstream models were automatically annotated by using NLP processors learned with n-cross fold validation on the training data. This way, the n chunks of training data are annotated avoiding dependencies with the data used for training the NLP processors. Syntax Predicted parse trees for English were produced using the Charniak parser 11 (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) . Some additional tag types used in the OntoNotes trees were added to the parser's tagset, including the nominal (NML) tag, and the rules used to determine head words were extended correspondingly. Chinese and Arabic parses were generated using the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) . In the case of Arabic, the parsing community uses a mapping from rich Arabic part of speech tags to Penn-style part of speech tags. We used the mapping that is included with the Arabic Treebank. The predicted parses for the training portion of the data were generated using 10-fold (5-folds for Arabic) cross-validation. For testing, we used a model trained on the entire training portion. Table 3 shows the precision, recall and F 1 -scores of the re-trained parsers on the CoNLL-2012 test along with the part of speech accuracies (POS) using the standard evalb scorer. The performance on the PT genre for English is the highest among other English genres. This is possibly because of the professional, clean translations of the underlying text, and are mostly shorter sentences. The MZ genre and the NW both of which contain well edited text, share similar scores. There is a few points gap between these and the other genres. As for Chinese, the performance on MZ is the highest followed by BN. Surprisingly, the WB genre has a similar score and the others are close behind except for TC. As expected, the Arabic parser performance is the low- est among the three languages. Word Sense We used the IMS 12 (It Makes Sense) (Zhong and Ng, 2010) word sense tagger. IMS was trained on all the word sense data that is present in the training portion of the OntoNotes corpus using crossvalidated predictions on the input layers similar to the proposition tagger. During testing, for English and Arabic, IMS must first use the automatic POS information to identify the nouns and verbs in the test data, and then assign senses to the automatically identified nouns and verbs. In the case of Arabic, IMS uses gold lemmas. Since automatic POS tagging is not perfect, IMS does not always output a sense to all word tokens that need to be sense tagged due to wrongly predicted POS tags. As such, recall is not the same as precision on the English and Arabic test data. For Chinese the measure of performance is just the accuracy since the senses are defined per lemma rather than per part of speech. Since we provide gold word segmentation, IMS attempts to sense tag all correctly segmented Chinese words, so recall and precision are the same and so is the F 1score. Table 4 shows the performance of this classifier aggregated over both the verbs and nouns in the CoNLL-2012 test set and an overall score split by nouns and verbs for English and Arabic. For both nouns and verbs in English, the F 1 -score is over 80%. The performance on English nouns is slightly higher than English verbs. Comparing to the other two languages, the performance on Arabic is relatively lower, especially the performance on Arabic verbs, whose F 1 -score is less than 70%. For English, genres PT and TC, and for Chinese genres TC and WB, no gold standard senses were available, and so their accuracies could not be computed. Previously, Zhong et al. (2008) Proposition The revised PropBank has introduced two new links -LINK-SLC and LINK-PCR. Since the community is not used to the new PropBank representation which (i) relies heavily on the trace structure in the Treebank and (ii) we decided to exclude, we unfold the LINKs back to their original representation as in the PropBank 1.0 release. We used ASSERT 15 (Pradhan et al., 2005) to predict the propositional structure for English. We made a small modification to ASSERT, and replaced the TinySVM classifier with a CRF 16 to speed up training the model on all the data. The Chinese propositional structure was predicted with the Chinese semantic role labeler described in (Xue, 2008) , retrained on the OntoNotes v5.0 data. The Arabic propositional structure was predicted using the system described in Diab et al. (2008) . (Diab et al., 2008) Table 5 shows the detailed per- Named Entities We retrained the Stanford named entity recognizer 20 (Finkel et al., 2005) on the OntoNotes data. Table 6 shows the performance details for all the languages across all 18 name types broken down by genre. In English, BN has the highest performance followed by the NW genre. There is a significant drop from those and the TC and WB genre. Somewhat similar trend is observed in the Chinese data, with Arabic having the lowest scores. Since the Pivot Text portion (PT) of OntoNotes was not tagged with names, we could not compute the accuracy for that cross-section of the data. Previously Finkel and Manning (2009) performed a joint estimation of named entity and parsing. However, it was on an earlier version of the English portion of OntoNotes using a different crosssection for training and testing and therefore is not directly comparable. Coreference The task is to automatically identify mentions of entities and events in text and to link the coreferring mentions together to form entity/event chains. The coreference decisions are made using automatically predicted information on other structural and semantic layers including the parses, semantic roles, word senses, and named entities that were produced in the earlier sections. Each document part from the documents that were split into multiple parts during coreference annotation were treated as separate document. We used the number and gender predictions generated by Bergsma and Lin (2006) . Unfortunately neither Arabic, nor Chinese have comparable data available. Chinese, in particular, does not have number or gender inflections for nouns, but (Baran and Xue, 2011) look at a way to infer such information. We trained the Bj\u00f6rkelund and Farkas (2012) coreference system 21 which uses a combination of two pair-wise resolvers, the first is an incremental chain-based resolution algorithm (Bj\u00f6rkelund and Farkas, 2012) , and the second is a best-first resolver (Ng and Cardie, 2002) . The two resolvers are combined by stacking, i.e., the output of the first resolver is used as features in the second one. The system uses a large feature set tailored for each language which, in addition to classic coreference features, includes both lexical and syntactic information. Recently, it was discovered that there is possibly a bug in the official scorer used for the CoNLL 2011/2012 and the SemEval 2010 coreference tasks. This relates to the mis-implementation of the method proposed by (Cai and Strube, 2010) for scoring predicted mentions. This issue has also been recently reported in Recasens et al., (2013) . As of this writing, the BCUBED metric has been fixed, and the correctness of the CEAF m , CEAF e and BLANC metrics is being verified. We will be updating the CoNLL shared task webpages 22 with more detailed information and also release the patched scripts as soon as they are available. We will also re-generate the scores for previous shared tasks, and the coreference layer in this paper and make them available along with the models and system outputs for other layers. Table 7 shows the performance of the system on the CoNLL-2012 test set, broken down by genre. The same metrics that were used for the CoNLL-2012 shared task are computed, with the CONLL column being the official CONLL measure. The varying results across genres mostly meet our expectations. In English, the system does best on TC and the PT genres. The text in the TC set often involve long chains where the speakers refer to themselves which, given speaker information, is fairly easy to resolve. The PT section includes many references to god (e.g. god and the lord) which the lexicalized resolver is quite good at picking up during training. The more difficult genres consist of texts where references to many entities are interleaved in the discourse and is as such harder to resolve correctly. For Chinese the numbers on the TC genre are also quite good, and the explanation above also holds here -many mentions refer to either of the speakers. For Chinese the NW section displays by far the highest scores, however, and the reason for this is not clear to us. Not surprisingly, restricting the set of mentions only to gold mentions gives a large boost across all genres and all languages. This shows that mention detection (MD) and singleton detection (which is not part of the annotation) remain a big source of errors for the coreference resolver. For these experiments we used a combination of training and development data for training -following the CoNLL-2012 shared task specification. Leaving out the development set has a very negligible effect on the CoNLLscore for all the languages (English: 0.14; Chinese 0.06; Arabic: 0.40 F-score respectively). The effect on Arabic is the most (0.40 F-score) most likely because of its much smaller size. To gauge the performance improvement between 2011 and 2012 shared tasks, we performed a clean comparison of over the best performing system and an earlier version of this system (Bj\u00f6rkelund and Nugues, 2011) ) 23 as opposed to the 54.53 reported in bj\u00f6rkelund (Bj\u00f6rkelund and Nugues, 2011) , and the 57.79 reported for the best performing system of CoNLL-2011. One caveat is that these score comparison are done using the earlier version (v4) of the CoNLL scorer. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see that within a short span of a year, there has been significant improvement in system performance -partially owing to cross-pollination of research generated through the shared tasks. Conclusion In this paper we reported work on finding a reasonable training, development and test split for the various layers of annotation in the OntoNotes v5.0 corpus, which consists of multiple genres in three typologically very different languages. We also presented the performance of publicly available, state-of-the-art algorithms on all the different layers of the corpus for the different languages. The trained models as well as their output will be made publicly available 24 to serve as benchmarks for language processing community. Training so many different NLP components is very time-consuming, thus, we hope the work reported here has lifted the burden of having to create reasonable baselines for researchers who wish to use this corpus to evaluate their systems. We created just one data split in training, development and test set, covering a collection of genres for each layer of annotation in each language in order to keep the workload manageable However, the results do not discriminate the performance on individual genres: we believe such a setup is still a more realistic gauge for the performance of the state-of-the-art NLP components than a monolithic corpus such as the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank. It can be used as a starting point for developing the next generation of NLP components that are more robust and perform well on a multitude of genres for a variety of different languages.
