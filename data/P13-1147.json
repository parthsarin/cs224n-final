The clear drawback of supervised methods is the need of training data: labeled data is expensive to obtain, and there is often a mismatch between the training data and the data the system will be applied to. This is the problem of domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose to combine (i) term generalization approaches such as word clustering and latent semantic analysis (LSA) and (ii) structured kernels to improve the adaptability of relation extractors to new text genres/domains. The empirical evaluation on ACE 2005 domains shows that a suitable combination of syntax and lexical generalization is very promising for domain adaptation. * The first author was affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering of the University of Trento (Povo, Italy) during the design of the models, experiments and writing of the paper. Introduction Relation extraction is the task of extracting semantic relationships between entities in text, e.g. to detect an employment relationship between the person Larry Page and the company Google in the following text snippet: Google CEO Larry Page holds a press announcement at its headquarters in New York on May 21, 2012. Recent studies on relation extraction have shown that supervised approaches based on either feature or kernel methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Bunescu, 2007; Nguyen et al., 2009; Chan and Roth, 2010; Sun et al., 2011) . However, the clear drawback of supervised methods is the need of training data, which can slow down the delivery of commercial applications in new domains: labeled data is expensive to obtain, and there is often a mismatch between the training data and the data the system will be applied to. Approaches that can cope with domain changes are essential. This is the problem of domain adaptation (DA) or transfer learning (TL). Technically, domain adaptation addresses the problem of learning when the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples is violated. Domain adaptation has been studied extensively during the last couple of years for various NLP tasks, e.g. two shared tasks have been organized on domain adaptation for dependency parsing (Nivre et al., 2007; Petrov and McDonald, 2012) . Results were mixed, thus it is still a very active research area. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is almost no work on adapting relation extraction (RE) systems to new domains. 1 There are some prior studies on the related tasks of multi-task transfer learning (Xu et al., 2008; Jiang, 2009) and distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) , which are clearly related but different: the former is the problem of how to transfer knowledge from old to new relation types, while distant supervision tries to learn new relations from unlabeled text by exploiting weak-supervision in the form of a knowledge resource (e.g. Freebase). We assume the same relation types but a shift in the underlying data distribution. Weak supervision is a promising approach to improve a relation extraction system, especially to increase its coverage in terms of types of relations covered. In this paper we examine the related issue of changes in the underlying data distribution, while keeping the relations fixed. Even a weakly supervised system is expected to perform well when applied to any kind of text (other domain/genre), thus ideally, we believe that combining domain adaptation with weak supervision is the way to go in the future. This study is a first step towards this. We focus on unsupervised domain adaptation, i.e. no labeled target data. Moreover, we consider a particular domain adaptation setting: singlesystem DA, i.e. learning a single system able to cope with different but related domains. Most studies on DA so far have focused on building a specialized system for every specific target domain, e.g. Blitzer et al. (2006) . In contrast, the goal here is to build a single system that can robustly handle several domains, which is in line with the setup of the recent shared task on parsing the web (Petrov and McDonald, 2012) . Participants were asked to build a single system that can robustly parse all domains (reviews, weblogs, answers, emails, newsgroups), rather than to build several domain-specific systems. We consider this as a shift in what was considered domain adaptation in the past (adapt from source to a specific target) and what can be considered a somewhat different recent view of DA, that became widespread since 2011/2012. The latter assumes that the target domain(s) is/are not really known in advance. In this setup, the domain adaptation problem boils down to finding a more robust system (S\u00f8gaard and Johannsen, 2012) , i.e. one wants to build a system that can robustly handle any kind of data. We propose to combine (i) term generalization approaches and (ii) structured kernels to improve the performance of a relation extractor on new domains. Previous studies have shown that lexical and syntactic features are both very important (Zhang et al., 2006) . We combine structural features with lexical information generalized by clusters or similarity. Given the complexity of feature engineering, we exploit kernel methods (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) . We encode word clusters or similarity in tree kernels, which, in turn, produce spaces of tree fragments. For example, \"president\", \"vice-president\" and \"Texas\", \"US\", are terms indicating an employment relation between a person and a location. Rather than only matching the surface string of words, lexical similarity enables soft matches between similar words in convolution tree kernels. In the empirical evaluation on Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) data, we evaluate the impact of convolution tree kernels embedding lexical semantic similarities. The latter is derived in two ways with: (a) Brown word clustering (Brown et al., 1992) ; and (b) Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). We first show that our system aligns well with the state of the art on the ACE 2004 benchmark. Then, we test our RE system on the ACE 2005 data, which exploits kernels, structures and similarities for domain adaptation. The results show that combining the huge space of tree fragments generalized at the lexical level provides an effective model for adapting RE systems to new domains. Semantic Syntactic Tree Kernels In kernel-based methods, both learning and classification only depend on the inner product between instances. Kernel functions can be efficiently and implicitly computed by exploiting the dual formulation: i=1..l y i \u03b1 i \u03c6(o i )\u03c6(o) + b = 0, where o i and o are two objects, \u03c6 is a mapping from an object to a feature vector x i and \u03c6(o i )\u03c6(o) = K(o i , o) is a kernel function implicitly defining such a mapping. In case of structural kernels, K determines the shape of the substructures describing the objects. Commonly used kernels in NLP are string kernels (Lodhi et al., 2002) and tree kernels (Moschitti, 2006; Moschitti, 2008) . Syntactic tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001) compute the similarity between two trees T 1 and T 2 by counting common sub-trees (cf. Figure 1 ), without enumerating the whole fragment space. However, if two trees have similar substructures that employ different though related terminal nodes, they will not be matched. This is clearly a limitation. For instance, the fragments corresponding to governor from Texas and head of Maryland are intuitively semantically related and should obtain a higher match when compared to mother of them. Semantic syntactic tree kernels (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007a; Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b; Croce et al., 2011) provide one way to address this problem by introducing similarity \u03c3 that allows soft matches between words and, consequently, between fragments containing them. Let N 1 and N 2 be the set of nodes in T 1 and T 2 , respectively. Moreover, let I i (n) be an indicator variable that is 1 if subtree i is rooted at n and 0 otherwise. The syntactic semantic convolution kernel T K \u03c3 (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b) over T 1 and T 2 is computed as T K \u03c3 (T 1, T 2) = n 1 \u2208N 1 ,n 2 \u2208N 2 \u2206 \u03c3 (n 1 , n 2 ) where \u2206 \u03c3 (n 1 , n 2 ) = n 1 \u2208N 1 n 2 \u2208N 2 i I i (n 1 )I i (n 2 ) is computed efficiently using the following recursive definition: i) If the nodes n 1 and n 2 are either different or have different number of children then \u2206 \u03c3 (n 1 , n 2 ) = 0; else ii) If n 1 and n 2 are pre-terminals then \u2206 \u03c3 (n 1 , n 2 ) = \u03bb nc(n 1 ) j=1 \u2206 \u03c3 (ch(n 1 , j), ch(n 2 , j)) , where \u03c3 measures the similarity between the corresponding children of n 1 and n 2 ; iii) If n 1 and n 2 have identical children: \u2206 \u03c3 (n 1 , n 2 ) = \u03bb nc(n 1 ) j=1 (1 + \u2206 \u03c3 (ch(n 1 , j)), ch(n 2 , j)); else \u2206 \u03c3 (n 1 , n 2 ) = 0. T K \u03c3 combines generalized lexical with structural information: it allows matching tree fragments that have the same syntactic structure but differ in their terminals. After introducing related work, we will discuss computational structures for RE and their extension with semantic similarity. Related Work Semantic syntactic tree kernels have been previously used for question classification (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007a; Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b; Croce et al., 2011) . These kernels have not yet been studied for either domain adaptation or RE. Brown clusters were studied previously for feature-based approaches to RE (Sun et al., 2011; Chan and Roth, 2010 ), but they were not yet evaluated in kernels. Thus, we present a novel application of semantic syntactic tree kernels and Brown clusters for domain adaptation of tree-kernel based relation extraction. Regarding domain adaptation, several methods have been proposed, ranging from instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) to approaches that change the feature representation (Daum\u00e9 III, 2007) or try to exploit pivot features to find a generalized shared representation between domains (Blitzer et al., 2006) . The easy-adapt approach presented in Daum\u00e9 III (2007) assumes the supervised adaptation setting and is thus not applicable here. Structural correspondence learning (Blitzer et al., 2006) exploits unlabeled data from both source and target domain to find correspondences among features from different domains. These correspondences are then integrated as new features in the labeled data of the source domain. The key to SCL is to exploit pivot features to automatically identify feature correspondences, and as such is applicable to feature-based approaches but not in our case since we do not assume availability of target domain data. Instead, we apply a similar idea where we exploit an entire unlabeled corpus as pivot, and compare our approach to instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) . Instance weighting is a method for domain adaptation in which instance-dependent weights are assigned to the loss function that is minimized during the training process. Let l(x, y, \u03b8) be some loss function. Then, as shown in Jiang and Zhai (2007) , the loss function can be weighted by \u03b2 i l(x, y, \u03b8), such that \u03b2 i = Pt(x i ) Ps(x i ) , where P s and P t are the source and target distributions, respectively. Huang et al. (2007) present an application of instance weighting to support vector machines by minimizing the following re-weighted function: min \u03b8,\u03be 1 2 ||\u03b8|| 2 + C m i=1 \u03b2 i \u03be i . Finding a good weight function is non-trivial (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and several approximations have been evaluated in the past, e.g. S\u00f8gaard and Haulrich (2011) use a bigram-based text classifier to discriminate between domains. We will use a binary classifier trained on RE instance representations. Computational Structures for RE A common way to represent a constituency-based relation instance is the PET (path-enclosed-tree), the smallest subtree including the two target entities (Zhang et al., 2006) . This is basically the former structure PAF 2 (predicate argument feature) defined in Moschitti (2004) for the extraction of predicate argument relations. The syntactic rep-resentation used by Zhang et al. (2006) (we will refer to it as PET Zhang) is the PET with enriched entity information: e.g. E1-NAM-PER, including entity type (PER, GPE, LOC, ORG) and mention type (NAM, NOM, PRO, PRE: name, nominal, pronominal or premodifier). An alternative kernel that does not use syntactic information is the Bag-of-Words (BOW) kernel, where a single root node is added above the terminals. Note that in this BOW kernel we actually mark target entities with E1/E2. Therefore, our BOW kernel can be considered an enriched BOW model. If we do not mark target entities, performance drops considerably, as discussed later. As shown by Zhang et al. (2006) , including gold-standard information on entity and mention type substantially improves relation extraction performance. We will use this gold information also in Section 6.1 to show that our system aligns well to the state of the art on the ACE 2004 benchmark. However, in a realistic setting this information is not available or noisy. In fact, as we discuss later, excluding gold entity information decreases system performance considerably. In the case of porting a system to new domains entity information will be unreliable or missing. Therefore, in our domain adaptation experiments on the ACE 2005 data (Section 6.3) we will not rely on this gold information but rather train a system using PET (target mentions only marked with E1/E2 and no gold entity label). 3 Syntactic Semantic Structures Combining syntax with semantics has a clear advantage: it generalizes lexical information encapsulated in syntactic parse trees, while at the same time syntax guides semantics in order to obtain an effective semantic similarity. In fact, lexical information is highly affected by data-sparseness, thus tree kernels combined with semantic information created from additional resources should provide a way to obtain a more robust system. We exploit this idea here for domain adaptation (DA): if words are generalized by semantic similarity LS, then in a hypothetical world changing LS such that it reflects the target domain would allow the system to perform better in the target domain. The question remains how to establish a link between the semantic similarity in the source and target domain. We propose to use an entire unlabeled corpus as pivot: this corpus must be general enough to encapsulate the source and target domains of interest. The idea is to (i) learn semantic similarity between words on the pivot corpus and (ii) use tree kernels embedding such a similarity to learn a RE system on the source, which allows to generalize to the new target domain. This reasoning is related to Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) (Blitzer et al., 2006) . In SCL, a representation shared across domains is learned by exploiting pivot features, where a set of pivot features has to be selected (usually a few thousands). In our case pivots are words that cooccur with the target words in a large unlabeled corpus and are thus implicitly represented in the similarity matrix. Thus, in contrast to SCL, we do not need to select a set of pivot features but rather rely on the distributional hypothesis to infer a semantic similarity from a large unlabeled corpus. Then, this similarity is incorporated into the tree kernel that provides the necessary restriction for an effective semantic similarity calculation. One peculiarity of our work is that we exploit a large amount of general data, i.e. data gathered from the web, which is a different but also more challenging scenario than the general unsupervised DA setting where domain specific data is available. We study two ways for term generalization in tree kernels: Brown words clusters and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), both briefly described next. The Brown algorithm (Brown et al., 1992 ) is a hierarchical agglomerative hard-clustering algorithm. The path from the root of the tree down to a leaf node is represented compactly as a bitstring. By cutting the hierarchy at different levels one can obtain different granularities of word clusters. We evaluate different ways to integrate cluster information into tree kernels, some of which are illustrated in Figure 2 . For LSA, we compute term similarity functions following the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1964) , i.e. the meaning of a word can be described by the set of textual contexts in which it appears. The original word-by-word context matrix M is decomposed through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Golub and Kahan, 1965) , where M is approximated by U l S l V T l . This approximation supplies a way to project a generic term w i into the l-dimensional space using W = U l S 1/2 l , where each row corresponds to the vectors w i . Given two words w 1 and w 2 , the term similarity function \u03c3 is estimated as the cosine similarity between the corresponding projections w 1 , w 2 and used in the kernel as described in Section 2. Experimental Setup We treat relation extraction as a multi-class classification problem and use SVM-light-TK 4 to train the binary classifiers. The output of the classifiers is combined using the one-vs-all approach. We modified the SVM-light-TK package to include the semantic tree kernels and instance weighting. The entire software package is publicly available. 5 For the SVMs, we use the same parameters as Zhang et al. (2006) : \u03bb = 0.4, c = 2.4 using the Collins Kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001) . The precision/recall trade-off parameter for the none class was found on held-out data: j = 0.2. Evaluation metrics are standard micro average Precision, Recall and balanced Fscore (F1). To compute statistical significance, we use the approximate randomization test (Noreen, 1989) . 6 In all our experiments, we model argument order of the relations explicitly. Thus, for instance for the 7 coarse ACE 2004 relations, we build 14 coarse-grained classifiers (two for each coarse ACE 2004 relation type except for PER-SOC, which is symmetric, and one classifier for the none relation). Data We use two datasets. To compare our model against the state of the art we use the ACE 2004 data. It contains 348 documents and 4,374 positive relation instances. To generate the training data, we follow prior studies and extract an instance for every pair of mentions in the same 4 http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/Tree-Kernel.htm 5 http://disi.unitn.it/ikernels/RelationExtraction 6 http://www.nlpado.de/ \u02dcsebastian/software/sigf.shtml sentence, which are separated by no more than three other mentions (Zhang et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2011) 1 . Note that this data is different from ACE 2004: it covers different years (ACE 2004 (ACE : texts from 2001 (ACE -2002;; ACE 2005 ACE : 2003 ACE -2005)) . Moreover, the annotation guidelines have changed (for example, ACE 2005 contains no discourse relation, some relation (sub)types have changed/moved, and care must be taken for differences in SGM markup, etc.). More importantly, the ACE 2005 corpus covers additional domains: weblogs, telephone conversation, usenet and broadcast conversation. In the experiments, we use news (the union of nw and bn) as source domain, and weblogs (wl), telephone conversations (cts) and broadcast conversation (bc) as target domains. 7 We take half of bc as only target development set, and leave the remaining data and domains for final testing (since they are already small, cf. Table 1 ). To get a feeling of how these domains differ, Figure 3 depicts the distribution of relations in each domain and Table 2 provides the most frequent out-of-vocabulary words together with their percentage. Lexical Similarity and Clustering We applied LSA to ukWaC (Baroni et al., 2009) , a 2 billion word corpus constructed from the Web 8 using the s-space toolkit. 9 Dimensionality reduction was performed using SVD with 250 dimensions, following (Croce et al., 2011) . The co-occurrence matrix was transformed by tfidf. For the Brown word clusters, we used Percy Liang's implementation 10 of the Brown clustering algorithm (Liang, 2005) . We incorporate cluster information by us-   ing the 10-bit cluster prefix (Sun et al., 2011; Chan and Roth, 2010) . For the domain adaptation experiments, we use ukWaC corpus-induced clusters as bridge between domains. We limited the vocabulary to that in ACE 2005, which are approximately 16k words. Following previous work, we left case intact in the corpus and induced 1,000 word clusters from words appearing at least 100 times. 11 DA baseline We compare our approach to instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) . We modified SVM-light-TK such that it takes a parameter vector \u03b2 i , .., \u03b2 m as input, where each \u03b2 i represents the relative importance of example i with respect to the target domain (Huang et al., 2007; Widmer, 2008) . To estimate the importance weights, we train a binary classifier that distinguishes between source and target domain instances. We consider the union of the three target domains as target data. To train the classifier, the source instances are marked as negative and the target instances are marked as positive. Then, this classi- 6 Results Alignment to Prior Work Although most prior studies performed 5-fold cross-validation on ACE 2004, it is often not clear whether the partitioning has been done on the instance or on the document level. Moreover, it is often not stated whether argument order is modeled explicitly, making it difficult to compare system performance. Citing Wang (2008) , \"We feel that there is a sense of increasing confusion down this line of research\". To ease comparison for future research we use the same 5-fold split on the document level as Sun et al. (2011) 13 and make our system publicly available (see Section 5). Table 3 shows that our system (bottom) aligns well with the state of the art. Our best system (composite kernel with polynomial expansion) reaches an F1 of 70.1, which aligns well to the 70.4 of Sun et al. (2011) that use the same datasplit. This is slightly behind that of Zhang (2006) ; the reason might be threefold: i) different data partitioning; ii) different pre-processing; iii) they incorporate features from additional sources, i.e. a phrase chunker, dependency parser and semantic resources (Zhou et al., 2005) (we have on average 9 features/instance, they use 40). Since we focus on evaluating the impact of semantic similarity in tree kernels, we think our system is very competitive. Removing gold entity and mention information results in a significant F1 drop from 66.3% to 54.2%. However, in a realistic setting we do not have gold entity info available, especially not in the case when we apply the system to any kind of text. Thus, in the domain adaptation setup we assume entity boundaries given but not their label. Clearly, evaluating the approach on predicted mentions, e.g. Giuliano et al. (2007) , is another important dimension, however, out of the scope of the current paper. Tree Kernels with Brown Word Clusters To evaluate the effectiveness of Brown word clusters in tree kernels, we evaluated different instance representations (cf. Figure 2 ) on the ACE 2005 development set. To summarize, we found: i) it is generally a bad idea to dismiss lexical information completely, i.e. replacing or ignoring terminals harms performance; ii) the best way to incorporate Brown clusters is to replace the Pos tag with the cluster bitstring; iii) marking all words is generally better than only mentions; this is in contrast to Sun et al. (2011) who found that in their feature-based system it was better to add cluster information to entity mentions only. As we will discuss, the combination of syntax and semantics exploited in this novel kernel avoids the necessity of restricting cluster information to mentions only. Semantic Tree Kernels for DA To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed kernels across domains, we use the ACE 2005 data as testbed. Following standard practices on ACE 2004, the newswire (nw) and broadcast news (bn) data from ACE 2005 are considered training data (labeled source domain). The test data consists of three targets: broadcast conversation, telephone conversation, weblogs. As we want to build a single system that is able to handle heterogeneous data, we do not assume that there is further unla-beled domain-specific data, but we assume to have a large unlabeled corpus (ukWaC) at our disposal to improve the generalizability of our models. Table 5 presents the results. In the first three rows we see the performance of the baseline models (PET, BOW and BOW without marking). In-domain (col 1): when evaluated on the same domain the system was trained on (nw+bn, 5-fold cross-validation). Out-of-domain performance (cols 2-4): the system evaluated on the targets, namely broadcast conversation (bc), telephone conversation (cts) and weblogs (wl). While the system achieves a performance of 46.0 F1 within its own domain, the performance drops to 45.3, 43.4 and 34.0 F1 on the target domains, respectively. The BOW kernel that disregards syntax is often less effective (row 2). We see also the effect of target entity marking: the BOW kernel without entity marking performs substantially worse (row 3). For the remaining experiments we use the BOW kernel with entity marking. Rows 4 and 5 of Table 5 show the effect of using instance weighting for the PET baseline. Two models are shown: they differ in whether PET or BOW was used as instance representation for training the discriminative classifier. Instance weighting shows mixed results: it helps slightly on the weblogs domain, but does not help on broadcast conversation and telephone conversations. Interestingly, the two models used to obtain the weights perform similarly, despite the fact that their performance differs (F1: 70.5 BOW, 73.5 PET); it turns out that the correlation between the weights is high (+0.82). The next part (rows 6-9) shows the effect of enriching the syntactic structures with either Brown word clusters or LSA. The Brown cluster kernel applied to PET (P WC) improves performance over the baseline over all target domains. The same holds also for the lexical semantic kernel based on LSA (P LSA), however, to only two out of three domains. This suggests that the two kernels capture different information and a combined kernel might be effective. More importantly, the table shows the effect of adding Brown clusters or LSA semantics to the BOW kernel: it can actually hurt performance, sometimes to a small but other times to a considerably degree. For instance, WC applied to PET achieves an F1 of 47.0 (baseline: 45.3) on the bc domain, while applied to BOW it hurts performance significantly, i.e. it drops from 45.0 to 41.2. This is also the case for LSA applied to the BOW kernel, which drops to 41.9. On the cts domain this is less pronounced. Only on the weblogs domain B LSA achieves a minor improvement (from 32.7 to 33.0). In general, distributional semantics constrained by syntax (i.e. combined with PET) can be effectively exploited, while if applied 'blindly' -without the guide of syntax (i.e. BOW) -performance might drop, often considerably. We believe that the semantic information does not help the BOW kernel as there is no syntactic information that constrains the application of the noisy source, as opposed to the case with the PET kernel. As the two semantically enriched kernels, PET LSA and PET WC, seem to capture different information we use composite kernels (rows 10-11): the baseline kernel (PET) summed with the lexical semantic kernels. As we can see, results improve further: for instance on the bc test set, PET WC reaches an F1 of 47.0, while combined with PET (PET+PET WC) this improves to 48.3. Adding also PET LSA results in the best performance and our final system (last row): the composite kernel (PET+PET WC+PET LSA) reaches an F1 of 48.5, 43.6 and 37.8 on the target domains, respectively, i.e. with an absolute improvement of: +3.2%, +0.2% and +3.8%, respectively. Two out of three improvements are significant at p < 0.05 (indicated by \u2020 in Table 5 ). Moreover, the system also improved in its own domain (first column), therefore having achieved robustness. By performing an error analysis we found that, for instance, the Brown clusters help to generalize locations and professions. For example, the baseline incorrectly considered 'Dutch filmmaker' in a PART-WHOLE relation, while our system correctly predicted GEN-AFF(filmmaker,Dutch). 'Filmmaker' does not appear in the source, however 'Dutch citizen' does. Both 'citizen' and 'filmmaker' appear in the same cluster, thereby helping the system to recover the correct relation. 2005) . SYS is the final model, i.e. last row (PET+PET WC+PET LSA) of Table 5 . Furthermore, Table 6 provides the performance breakdown per relation for the baseline (BL) and our best system (SYS). The table shows that our system is able to improve F1 on all relations for the broadcast and weblogs data. On most relations, this is also the case for the telephone (cts) data, although the overall improvement is not significant. Most errors were made on the PER-SOC relation, which constitutes the largest portion of cts (cf. Figure 3 ). As shown in the same figure, the relation distribution of the cts domain is also rather different from the source. This conversation data is a very hard domain, with a lot of disfluencies and spoken language patterns. We believe it is more distant from the other domains, especially from the unlabeled collection, thus other approaches might be more appropriate, e.g. domain identification (Dredze et al., 2010) . Conclusions and Future Work We proposed syntactic tree kernels enriched by lexical semantic similarity to tackle the portability of a relation extractor to different domains. The results of diverse kernels exploiting (i) Brown clustering and (ii) LSA show that a suitable combination of syntax and lexical generalization is very promising for domain adaptation. The proposed system is able to improve performance significantly on two out of three target domains (up to 8% relative improvement). We compared it to instance weighting, which gave only modest or no improvements. Brown clusters remained unexplored for kernel-based approaches. We saw that adding cluster information blindly might actually hurt performance. In contrast, adding lexical information combined with syntax can help to improve performance: the syntactic structure enriched with lexical information provides a feature space where syntax constrains lexical similarity obtained from unlabeled data. Thus, semantic syntactic tree kernels appear to be a suitable mechanism to adequately trade off the two kinds of information. In future we plan to extend the evaluation to predicted mentions, which necessarily includes a careful evaluation of pre-processing components, as well as evaluating the approach on other semantic tasks.

The clear drawback of supervised methods is the need of training data: labeled data is expensive to obtain, and there is often a mismatch between the training data and the data the system will be applied to. This is the problem of domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose to combine (i) term generalization approaches such as word clustering and latent semantic analysis (LSA) and (ii) structured kernels to improve the adaptability of relation extractors to new text genres/domains. The empirical evaluation on ACE 2005 domains shows that a suitable combination of syntax and lexical generalization is very promising for domain adaptation. * The first author was affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering of the University of Trento (Povo, Italy) during the design of the models, experiments and writing of the paper.",
