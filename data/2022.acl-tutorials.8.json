    "article": "Motivation and Objectives Enabling machines to intelligently converse with humans in order to solve particular well-defined tasks is in the core focus of task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems and their development (Kim and Banchs, 2014; Li et al., 2018; Henderson et al., 2019; Zang et al., 2020) . Such systems have wide applications in a multitude of domains such as hospitality industry, travel, e-banking, healthcare, entertainment industry, industrial production and maintenance, etc. TOD-oriented research has been recently catalysed by the growing ability and viability of deep learning techniques such as largescale pretraining of language models (Ren et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2019; Henderson et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020, inter alia) . The momentum of development in this research area has, however, mainly targeted a very small proportion of potential beneficiaries: most existing TOD systems are predominantly built for English and a few other, major languages only (e.g., Chinese) (Lin et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2021) . This limits the use, global reach, and transformative potential of TOD systems. Consequently, this deepens the chasm between speakers of dominant versus underrepresented low-resource languages in their access to state-of-the-art language technology (Joshi et al., 2020; Blasi et al., 2021) and contributes to the digital language divide and inequality of information. 1  Extending the reach of TOD technology is crucial for the democratisation and wide adoption of human-machine communication, with an inclusive long-term goal of bringing it to virtually all citizens of the world. Building on top of our recent comprehensive survey on the topic of multilingual TOD (Razumovskaia et al., 2021) , in this tutorial our aim is to systematise the current research on multilingual TOD, and offer a fresh perspective to other researchers and NLP practitioners on the importance and challenges of developing multilingual TOD systems. The tutorial will offer a comprehensive overview of multilingual TOD research and know-hows focused on the following central questions: 2 (Q1) Why are multilingual TOD systems so hard to build? What are the main roadblocks and how can we facilitate their development? What are the main design paradigms of multilingual TOD? (Q2) Which TOD datasets are currently available in one or more languages other than English? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can we improve the current data design and collection efforts and protocols? (Q3) What are the best methods and practices to incorporate language-specific information and perform target language adaptation for multilingual and cross-lingual TOD? (Q4) How can multilingual TOD take inspiration from other related fields of NLP research to better tackle low-resource scenarios (e.g., cross-lingual transfer, injection of external knowledge into parameters of neural models)? Part I will cover the basics of modular and end-toend dialogue systems (Young, 2010; Chen et al., 2017a; Wen et al., 2017; Ham et al., 2020) , offering a brief overview of the full TOD system structure, and critical modules such as Speech-totext/ASR, natural language understanding (NLU) for dialogue, dialogue state tracking (DST), dialogue management (DM), natural language generation (NLG), and text-to-speech (TTS), along with their functionality. We will analyse which components require language-specific processing and adaptation, and which modules are generally language-invariant. We will then proceed to define the detailed scope and schedule of the tutorial. Concretely, we plan to list and discuss all the current problems and challenges related to multilingual TOD development, and how we will introduce them in the subsequent tutorial parts. Topics overview: \u2022 Main modules of TOD systems; \u2022 Modular versus end-to-end TOD; \u2022 Text-based (vs. other) TOD modules; \u2022 Language-invariant vs. language-specific TOD modules; \u2022 Why is development of multilingual TOD systems so difficult? Part II: Methods and Resources for Multilingual NLU in TOD (50 minutes) Part II will cover to-date work in multilingual NLU in ToD, including standard approaches and recent trends. We will provide a comprehenstive overview of methods for learning cross-lingual representation spaces in ToD (Liu et al., 2019; Siddhant et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Moghe et al., 2021) and their applications in different setups (multilingual vs. cross-lingual, zero-shot vs. few-shot). Finally, we will list available resources: those created specifically for multilingual ToD NLU (Ding et al., 2021; Zuo et al., 2021; Hung et al., 2022, inter Part III: Methods and Resources for Multilingual NLG in TOD (35 minutes) Part III will present the methods for multilingual natural language generation and their usage for cross-lingual transfer of TOD. First, we will discuss traditional, grammar-based methods for cross-lingual generation (Gatt and Krahmer, 2018; Vaudry and Lapalme, 2013) Part IV: Evaluation of Multilingual TOD Systems (30 minutes) Part IV will focus on evaluation for (multilingual) TOD. We will cover both automatic metrics and human evaluation: automatic metrics allow for faster development cycles, but often do not correlate with user satisfaction with TOD systems (Liu et al., 2016; Novikova et al., 2017) . We will discuss the shortcomings of automated TOD evaluation, but also the potential pitfalls of human evaluation (Clark et al., 2021) . We will then analyse the difficulties that multilingual setups pose for both automatic metrics and human evaluation, including evaluation of generated responses in morpho-logically rich languages and difficulty of finding qualified evaluators for rare languages. Topics: \u2022 Current evaluation protocols in TOD; \u2022 Automatic vs. human-centered evaluation in multilingual setups: pros and cons; \u2022 How to evaluate language-specific phenomena and fluency; \u2022 Difficulties in evaluation and current gaps in evaluation resources. Part V: Open Challenges and Research Directions in Multilingual TOD (40 minutes) In the concluding Part V, we will discuss the main open challenges impeding the development of TOD systems and reflect on the promising avenues for further progress. First, we will advocate for linguistically motivated design of multilingual TOD datasets focusing on linguistic diversity and idiomacity. To fulfill their role as gauges of model performance across languages (Hu et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020) , multilingual datasets should (i) maximise diversity along the dimensions of language family, geographic area, and typological features (Ponti et al., 2020) . as well as (ii) adequately represent the linguistic and extra-linguistic (e.g., world knowledge, cultural references) properties of selected languages (rather than replicating dialogue structures, topics, and entities from a resource-rich source language). We will discuss first attempts at cultural adaptation for dialogue (Majewska et al., 2022) . Second, we will outline how existing strategies for dealing with data scarcity can be borrowed from other NLP tasks to benefit multilingual and cross-lingual TOD NLU (Ponti et al., 2019; Hedderich et al., 2021) . Third, we will emphasise the importance of user-centered evaluation as a way of assessing the fluency of generated responses and guiding improvements in ToD systems across different languages. Finally, we will discuss the significance of developments in multilingual ASR and TTS as keys to the ultimate success of multilingual ToD on a wide scale, and the potential of integrating speech-based and text-based modules in future research. Topics: \u2022 Recommendations for creation of future multilingual TOD datasets: linguistic diversity and idiomacity, low-resource languages, expansion to new domains; \u2022 Coping with low-resource scenarios: methods and lessons learned from other NLP tasks and applications; source selection for multi-source transfer and multilingual training; \u2022 Fluency of generation, code switching; \u2022 From text-based to voice-based multilingual TOD: promises and challenges; \u2022 An overview of other related research areas that can benefit multilingual TOD; \u2022 Listing key challenges, a short panel discussion and a QA session. Tutorial Breadth and Diversity According to the representative set of papers listed in the selected bibliography as well as in our recent survey paper (Razumovskaia et al., 2021) , we anticipate that a total of 20%-25% of the tutorial concerns work which involves at least one of the five presenters. The rest of the tutorial will focus on providing a detailed comprehensive overview of the main topic by covering all the relevant work from other researchers: see again the wide bibliography and coverage in the survey paper. Diversity and Inclusion. We consider the following aspects. First, our tutorial proposal focuses on multilingual NLP and promotes the ultimate long-term goal of NLP research: bringing (humancentered) language technology to minor and underresourced languages, and acting as a vehicle of mitigating the digital language divide (see the footnote 1). As such, it is highly relevant to both special themes of ACL 2022 and NAACL-HLT 2022. Our tutorial will also expose prominent issues and gaps related to (lack of) diversity and inclusivity of current multilingual TOD models and datasets, and we hope to inspire research groups currently working separately on (i) TOD and (ii) low-resource languages and low-resource NLP to consider joining forces and research expertise in the future. Concerning tutorial organization, we hope that our tutorial will connect researchers from different cultural backgrounds and research fields. We also note that two out of five tutorial presenters are female, and the pool of presenters offers a mix of more junior and experienced presenters.

Pre-tutorial reading list (examples): 6 Other Tutorial Information Related Tutorials. Conversational AI and (components of) TOD systems have been taught in several tutorials in past years, where the focus has been put on diverse aspects such as: deep learning techniques for TOD (Chen et al., ACL 2017; Su et al., NAACL-HLT 2018; Gao et al., ACL 2018) , data collection and end-to-end learning (Wen et al., EMNLP 2019) , or NLG methods (Ji et al., EMNLP 2020) and their evaluation (Khapra and Sai, NAACL-HLT 2021). However, our tutorial is the first to focus on the crucial aspects of multilingualism and low-resource languages in relation to the design, development, evaluation, and application of (multilingual) TOD systems. Our tutorial offers a completely novel and unique perspective to TOD also through the optics of multilingual NLP. Ethical Considerations. TOD systems can and should be used for greater good, but their use also comes with potential harmful implications. As part of the tutorial, we will therefore also point to guidelines and required ethical standards related to TODoriented data collection and (user-centered) evaluation, and also provide an overview of potential threats in current TOD-oriented models (e.g., gender, race or religion biases (Barikeri et al., 2021) ). Furthermore, we will remind NLP researchers and practitioners to bear in mind potential data-and model-centered biases, and apply appropriate data filtering and debiasing techniques before deploying TOD systems in real-world settings.",
