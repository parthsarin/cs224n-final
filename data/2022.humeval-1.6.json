    "article": "This paper presents the Human Evaluation Datasheet (HEDS), a template for recording the details of individual human evaluation experiments in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and reports on first experience of researchers using HEDS sheets in practice. Originally taking inspiration from seminal papers by Bender and Friedman (2018), Mitchell et al. (2019), and Gebru et al. (2020), HEDS facilitates the recording of properties of human evaluations in sufficient detail, and with sufficient standardisation, to support comparability, meta-evaluation, and reproducibility assessments for human evaluations. These are crucial for scientifically principled evaluation, but the overhead of completing a detailed datasheet is substantial, and we discuss possible ways of addressing this and other issues observed in practice. Introduction Human evaluation plays a special role in NLP and NLG in particular as it is generally seen as the most reliable form of evaluation (Reiter and Belz, 2009; Novikova et al., 2017; Reiter, 2018) . Comparability and reproducibility of evaluations (both human and automatic) are gaining in recognition and importance across NLP, as the field develops towards scientific maturity. For both reasons, it is of concern that there continues to be little consensus or standard practice across all aspects of human evaluation in NLP. Other efforts are aimed at standardisation of evaluation methods and quality criteria (van der Lee et al., 2021; Gehrmann et al., 2021) . With the Human Evaluation Datasheet (HEDS) we wish to provide simply a way of recording properties of human evaluations in a standard hence comparable form (regardless of the level of standardisation of the deployed methods themselves). HEDS is a template for recording properties of single human evaluation experiments. It uses multiple-choice questions where possible, for in-creased standardisation and automatic comparability. HEDS is designed to be generally applicable to human evaluations across NLP. It consists of 29 experiment-level questions plus 17 for each quality criterion, available as an online form which also contains explanations and guidance for completing it. The idea is that researchers use completed forms for preregistration of experiments and for archiving their details, to aid in comparability of evaluations across experiments, meta-evaluation of evaluation methods, and reproducibility of results. Our intention is that HEDS should be suitable for all human evaluation experiments in NLP. Human evaluations in NLP typically get participants to assess system outputs or to interact with systems, but the HEDS sheet also accommodates what we call 'human-authored stand-ins' below, i.e. manually created 'system outputs' (e.g. in a wizard-of-oz scenario or when reference outputs are included in an evaluation) evaluated in a way that can at least in principle be used to evaluate actual system outputs. The sheet is completed for a single human evaluation experiment by which we mean an experiment that evaluates a single set of directly comparable systems in a single experimental design, but may assess multiple quality criteria. This is the intended meaning when we refer to 'the evaluation experiment' in questions below. Relationship to Existing Work A first version of the datasheet (HEDS 1.0) was reported via a non-archival pre-print (Shimorina and Belz, 2021) . In this paper, we present HEDS in its next revision (v2.0) alongside a summary of what we learnt from observing the datasheet being used in practice since its first publication. We focus discussion in this paper on Questions 4.1.1-4.2.3 (Sections 5 and 6) relating to quality criteria and their operationalisation: these caused some difficulty to users in practice, and were revised more substantively than other questions. The full datasheet is provided in the appendix for reference. HEDS directly benefited from several papers and resources. Questions 2.1-2.5 relating to evaluated system, and 4.3.1-4.3.8 relating to response elicitation, are based on Howcroft et al. (2020) , with some significant changes. Questions 4.1.1-4.2.3 relating to quality criteria, and some of the questions about system outputs, evaluators, and experimental design (3.1.1-3.2.3, 4.3.5, 4.3.6, 4.3.9-4.3.11) are based on Belz et al. (2020) . HEDS was also informed by van der Lee et al. (2019 van der Lee et al. ( , 2021) ) and by Gehrmann et al. (2021) 's 1 data card guide. More generally, the original inspiration for creating a 'datasheet' for describing human evaluation experiments of course comes from seminal papers by Bender and Friedman (2018) , Mitchell et al. (2019) and Gebru et al. (2020) . HEDS is related to other efforts in the NLP community related to reproducibility and ethics. Different NLP checklists have been introduced in recent years, e.g. the Reproducibility Checklist (Dodge et al., 2019) adopted by many conferences, and the ACL Rolling Review's Responsible NLP checklist. 2 These checklists mainly deal with the recreatability of computational experiments, details of used datasets and models, and risks and limitations of research studies and applications. The focus of HEDS is recording properties of human evaluation experiments, which are not covered by the above checklists. HEDS Structure and Resources The Human Evaluation Datasheet package consists of the following three resources: 1. The HEDS template: available at https:// forms.gle/MgWiKVu7i5UHeMNQ9; 2. Description and completion guidance: this document; 3. Scripts for automatically converting between the HEDS online form and alternative Markdown and LaTeX template formats: available at https://github.com/Shimorina/ human-evaluation-datasheet. A collection of completed HEDS datasheets is also available at the HEDS GitHub repository. The full HEDS sheet can be found in Appendix A. In its template form as well as in this paper, HEDS is divided into five sections, addressing topics and containing questions as follows: 1. Paper and Resources: HEDS Questions 1.1-1.3, listed in Appendix Section A.1; 2. Evaluated System: HEDS Questions 2.1-2.5, Section A.2; 3. Output Sample, Evaluators and Experimental Design: HEDS Questions 3.1.1-3.3.8, Section A.3; 4. Quality Criteria: HEDS Questions 4.1.1-4.3.11, listed in Section 6 of the paper and, for completeness also in Section A.4 in the Appendix-this section is completed separately for each quality criterion used as part of the same evaluation experiment; 5. Ethics: HEDS Questions 5.1-5.4, Section A.5. Section A.1 records bibliographic information: link to the paper reporting the evaluation experiment, shared evaluation resources (e.g., a webpage, repository), contact author details. Section A.2 describes information about outputs that are evaluated in the evaluation experiment and how they were produced. For example, it records the task performed by the system, types of system input and output, input and output language. Section A.3 collects information about the evaluated sample (size, selection process, statistical power), the evaluators participating in the experiment, and experimental design (collection method, quality assurance, conditions for evaluators). Section A.4 captures information about quality criteria assessed in the human evaluation experiment. We discuss this section in the main body of the paper in Section 6. Section A.5 relates to ethical aspects of the evaluation: approval by ethics committees, and collection of personal and other sensitive data. 4 Insights from Use of HEDS 1.0 in Practice HEDS 1.0 was used in the 2021 ReproGen Shared Task on Reproducibility of Evaluations in NLG 3 (Belz et al., 2021) . All shared task participants, as well as the authors of the original papers up for reproduction in Track A, completed the HEDS 1.0 form. Moreover, the HEDS 1.0 sheet was completed another three times outside of the shared task context. General feedback from users was that the HEDS 1.0 sheet was for the most part straightforward to complete, but that completion still represented a considerable overhead. This is the general conundrum of initiatives such as HEDS: what is the incentive for researchers to complete the sheet when (i) it is merely good scientific hygiene rather than a component of the work without which it could not be carried out, and (ii) it mainly benefits follow on research rather than the paper it is completed for? Unless it is a requirement for submission to a particular event, or it is generally expected practice, the tendency may always be to avoid the overhead. To address this, we are in the process of preparing a shorter version of the sheet, with the aim of cutting the effort involved in half, for use in contexts where less detail is acceptable. We also observed that there were a number of questions in HEDS 1.0 that users found difficult to complete for different reasons. Question 3.1.3 (What is the statistical power of the sample size?) posed difficulties partly because power calculations are a relatively new tool in NLP. We address this in this paper with additional information, and in the future by providing a new resource to support calculation. A more fundamental issue was caused by how HEDS 1.0 captured information about quality criteria, and the use of duplicate subsections for multiple quality criteria. We believe that this was due largely to insufficient context, motivation and explanation being provided in the documentation and form about quality criteria and their properties, and we seek to provide the latter in version 2.0 (in this paper as well as in the form). Using HEDS as part of the ReproGen shared task demonstrated the utility of having information about original studies and reproduction studies available in the same standard format: it meant it was straightforward for organisers to capture and analyse the similarities and differences between original and reproduction studies, e.g. to identify sources of variation in results for the results report (Belz et al., 2021) . It also gave participants (authors of reproduction papers) a tool with which to verify whether their reproduction study of human evaluation was the same as the original study in all important respects, at a fine-grained level of detail. Concepts Underlying Quality Criterion Questions 4.1.1-4.3.11 in HEDS The overall aim of human evaluations in NLP is generally to assess some aspect of the quality of a system or component. Researchers use terms such as Fluency and Informativeness to refer to different aspects of quality. However, as discussed in detail by Howcroft et al. (2020) and Belz et al. (2020) , just because two studies used the same term (e.g. Fluency) it does not mean they evaluated the same aspect of quality. In order to establish what was evaluated, we need to know the term and definition used, but also how it was 'operationalised,' i.e. what was presented to evaluators and how their assessments were recorded. This is why HEDS, picking up from the two publications above, records properties relating to evaluation criteria and their operationalisation separately for each quality criterion. Because within the same experiment different quality criteria are often assessed in similar ways (e.g. using the same rating instrument), this can result in some repetition when completing a HEDS sheet, albeit unfortunately not in predictable ways. Following Belz et al. (2020) , properties relating to quality criteria and their operationalisation in HEDS fall into three groups: quality criteria, evaluation mode, and experimental design. A quality criterion is a criterion in terms of which the quality of system outputs is assessed, and is in itself entirely agnostic about how it is evaluated. Evaluation modes are properties that need to be specified to turn a quality criterion into an evaluation measure that can be implemented, and are orthogonal to quality criteria, i.e. any given quality criterion can be combined with any mode. Experimental design is the full specification of how to obtain a quantitative or qualitative response value for a given evaluation measure, yielding a fully specified evaluation method. In sum: \u2022 Quality criterion + evaluation mode = evaluation measure; \u2022 Evaluation measure + experimental design = evaluation method. Each of the above concepts is covered by one or more questions in HEDS. Three HEDS questions capture properties of quality criteria in terms of (i) what type of quality is being assessed (Question 4.1.1); (ii) what aspect of the system output is being assessed (Question 4.1.2); and (iii) whether system outputs are assessed in their own right or with reference to some system-internal or systemexternal frame of reference (Question 4.1.3). Three questions capture evaluation mode: (i) subjective vs. objective (Question 4.2.1), (ii) absolute vs. relative (Question 4.2.2), and (iii) intrinsic vs. extrinsic (Question 4.2.3). Experimental design is covered by Questions 4.3.1-11 (operationalisation of quality criteria assessment), and Questions 3.* (other aspects). We present, explain and discuss each of the above questions in the following section. HEDS Questions about Properties of Quality Criteria and their Operationalisation In this section, we present, verbatim, the questions referred to in the last section relating to properties of quality criteria and their operationalisation. All questions in this section need to be completed once for each quality criterion assessed in the single evaluation experiment that a HEDS sheet is being completed for. E.g. if an evaluation assesses Fluency and Grammaticality, then the questions below need to be filled in, separately, for each. We refer below to 'output' as shorthand for that which is being assessed by evaluators. The latter is most often some form of language output assessed at different lengths (phrase, sentence, document), but it can also be a more complete form of system behaviour (e.g. language displayed along with audio and/or visual elements, on interfaces, etc.). It is in this more general sense that we intend the term 'output' to be understood in the present context. 6.1 Quality criterion properties  Questions 4.1.1-4.1.3 capture the aspect of quality that is assessed by a given quality criterion, in terms of three orthogonal properties. They help determine whether or not the same aspect of quality is being evaluated in different evaluation experiments. The three properties characterise quality criteria in terms of (i) what type of quality is being assessed; (ii) what aspect of the system output is being assessed; and (iii) whether system outputs are assessed in their own right or with reference to some system-internal or system-external frame of reference. For full explanations see Belz et al. (2020) . Note that if NLP had a generally accepted standard set of quality criteria with common names, definitions and operationalisations, then most of the questions in this section could be replaced by a much smaller set capturing criterion name and operationalising techniques. The reason there are so many questions is precisely because we do not have such a standard nomenclature. Question 4.1.1: What type of quality is assessed by the quality criterion? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Correctness: Select this option if it is possible to state, generally for all outputs, the conditions under which outputs are maximally correct (hence of maximal quality). E.g. for Grammaticality, 4 outputs are (maximally) correct if they contain no grammatical errors; for Semantic Completeness, outputs are correct if they express all the content in the input. \u2022 Goodness: Select this option if, in contrast to correctness criteria, there is no single, general mechanism for deciding when outputs are maximally good, only for deciding for any two outputs which is better and which is worse. E.g. for Fluency, even if outputs contain no disfluencies, there may be other ways in which any given output could be more fluent. \u2022 Feature: Choose this option if, in terms of property X captured by the criterion, outputs are not generally better if they are more X, but instead, depending on evaluation context, more X may be either better or worse. E.g. for Specificity, outputs can be more specific or less specific, but it's not the case that outputs are, in the general case, better when they are more specific. Question 4.1.2: Which aspect of system outputs is assessed by the quality criterion? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Form of output: Choose this option if the criterion assesses the form of outputs alone, e.g. Grammaticality is only about the form, a sentence can be grammatical yet be wrong or nonsensical in terms of content. \u2022 Content of output: Select this option if the criterion assesses the content/meaning of the output alone, e.g. Meaning Preservation only assesses content; two sentences can be considered to have the same meaning, but differ in form. \u2022 Both form and content of output: Choose this option if the criterion assesses outputs as a whole, not just form or just content. E.g. Coherence is a property of outputs as a whole, either form or meaning can detract from it. Inherently extrinsic criteria such as Usefulness or Task Completion also fall in this category. Question 4.1.3: Is each output assessed for quality in its own right, or with reference to a system-internal or external frame of reference? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Quality of output in its own right: Select this option if output quality is assessed without referring to anything other than the output itself, i.e. no system-internal or external frame of reference. E.g. Poeticness is assessed by considering (just) the output and how poetic it is. \u2022 Quality of output relative to the input: Choose this option if output quality is assessed relative to the input. E.g. Answerability is the degree to which the output question can be answered from information in the input. \u2022 Quality of output relative to a system-external frame of reference: Choose this option if output quality is assessed with reference to systemexternal information, such as a knowledge base, a person's individual writing style, or the performance of an embedding system. E.g. Factual Accuracy assesses outputs relative to a source of real-world knowledge. 6.2 Evaluation mode properties (Questions 4.2.1-4.2.3) Questions 4.2.1-4.2.3 record properties that are orthogonal to quality criteria (covered by questions in the preceding section), i.e. any given quality criterion can in principle be combined with any of the modes (although some combinations are more common than others). Question 4.2.1: Does an individual assessment involve an objective or a subjective judgment? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Objective: Choose this option if the evaluation uses objective assessment, e.g. any automatically counted or otherwise quantified measurements such as mouse-clicks, occurrences in text, etc. Repeated assessments of the same output with an objective-mode evaluation method always yield the same score/result. \u2022 Subjective: Choose this option in all other cases. Subjective assessments involve ratings, opinions and preferences by evaluators. Some criteria lend themselves more readily to subjective assessments, e.g. Friendliness of a conversational agent, but an objective measure e.g. based on lexical markers is also conceivable. Question 4.2.2: Are outputs assessed in absolute or relative terms? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Absolute: Select this option if evaluators are shown outputs from a single system during each individual assessment. \u2022 Relative: Choose this option if evaluators are shown outputs from multiple systems at the same time during assessments, typically ranking or preference-judging them. Question 4.2.3: Is the evaluation intrinsic or extrinsic? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Intrinsic: Choose this option if quality of outputs is assessed without considering their effect on something external to the system, e.g. the performance of an embedding system or of a user at a task. \u2022 Extrinsic: Choose this option if quality of outputs is assessed in terms of their effect on something external to the system such as the performance of an embedding system or of a user at a task. What to enter in the text box: The number of different response values for this quality criterion. E.g. for a 5-point Likert scale, the size to enter is 5. For two-way forced-choice preference judgments, it is 2; if there's also a no-preference option, enter 3. For a slider that is mapped to 100 different values for the purpose of recording assessments, the size to enter is 100. If no rating instrument is used (e.g. when evaluation gathers post-edits or qualitative feedback only), enter 'N/A'. 6.3 Question 4.3.4: List or range of possible values of the scale or other rating instrument. Enter 'N/A', if there is no rating instrument. What to enter in the text box: list, or give the range of, the possible values of the rating instrument. The list or range should be of the size specified in Question 4.3.3. If there are too many to list, use a range. E.g. for two-way forced-choice preference judgments, the list entered might be A better, B better; if there's also a no-preference option, the list might be A better, B better, neither. For a slider that is mapped to 100 different values for the purpose of recording assessments, the range 1-100 might be entered. If no rating instrument is used (e.g. when evaluation gathers post-edits or qualitative feedback only), enter 'N/A'. Question 4.3.5: How is the scale or other rating instrument presented to evaluators? If none match, select 'Other' and describe. Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Multiple-choice options: choose this option if evaluators select exactly one of multiple options. \u2022 Check-boxes: choose this option if evaluators select any number of options from multiple given options. \u2022 Slider: choose this option if evaluators move a pointer on a slider scale to the position corresponding to their assessment. \u2022 N/A (there is no rating instrument): choose this option if there is no rating instrument. \u2022 Other (please specify): choose this option if there is a rating instrument, but none of the above adequately describe the way you present it to evaluators. Use the text box to describe the rating instrument and link to a screenshot. \u2022 (dis)agreement with quality statement: Participants specify the degree to which they agree with a given quality statement by indicating their agreement on a rating instrument. The rating instrument is labelled with degrees of agreement and can additionally have numerical labels. E.g. This text is fluent -1=strongly disagree...5=strongly agree. \u2022 direct quality estimation: Participants are asked to provide a rating using a rating instrument, which typically (but not always) mentions the quality criterion explicitly. E.g. How fluent is this text? -1=not at all fluent...5=very fluent. \u2022 relative quality estimation (including ranking): Participants evaluate two or more items in terms of which is better. E.g. Rank these texts in terms of fluency; Which of these texts is more fluent?; Which of these items do you prefer?. \u2022 counting occurrences in text: Evaluators are asked to count how many times some type of phenomenon occurs, e.g. the number of facts contained in the output that are inconsistent with the input. \u2022 qualitative feedback (e.g. via comments entered in a text box): Typically, these are responses to open-ended questions in a survey or interview. \u2022 evaluation through post-editing/annotation: Choose this option if the evaluators' task consists of editing or inserting annotations in text. E.g. evaluators may perform error correction and edits are then automatically measured to yield a numerical score. \u2022 output classification or labelling: Choose this option if evaluators assign outputs to categories. E.g. What is the overall sentiment of this piece of text? -Positive/neutral/negative. \u2022 user-text interaction measurements: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment interact with a text in some way, and measurements are taken of their interaction. E.g. reading speed, eye movement tracking, comprehension questions, etc. Excludes situations where participants are given a task to solve and their performance is measured which comes under the next option. \u2022 task performance measurements: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment are given a task to perform, and measure-ments are taken of their performance at the task. E.g. task is finding information, and task performance measurement is task completion speed and success rate. \u2022 user-system interaction measurements: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment interact with a system in some way, while measurements are taken of their interaction. E.g. duration of interaction, hyperlinks followed, number of likes, or completed sales. Conclusion In this paper we have presented the Human Evaluation Datasheet (HEDS), intended as a way of recording properties of human evaluations in NLP in a sufficiently standardised way to support comparability between evaluation experiments, metaevaluation of evaluation methods, and reproducibility assessments of evaluation results. We have reported insights from observing HEDS 1.0 being used in practice, and have described improvements we have made in response to these insights. In particular, we have provided additional context, motivation and explanation to the HEDS questions relating to evaluation criteria assessed in evaluation experiments and their operationalisation. Moreover, we are currently developing a shorter version of HEDS, a version with reduced effort for use in certain contexts. We view HEDS as continuing to develop in response to feedback received and insights gathered through use in practice. We continue to welcome feedback on any aspect of HEDS, and hope the growing repository of completed sheets will prove useful for future comparisons, meta-evaluation and reproducibility assessments, as demonstrated in the ReproGen shared task.

A.2 System Questions 2.1-2.5 Questions 2.1-2.5 record information about the system(s) (or human-authored stand-ins) whose outputs are evaluated in the Evaluation experiment that this sheet is being completed for. The input, output, and task questions in this section are closely interrelated: the value for one partially determines the others, as indicated for some combinations in Question 2.3. Question 2.1: What type of input do the evaluated system(s) take? Select all that apply. If none match, select 'Other' and describe. Describe the type of input, where input refers to the representations and/or data structures shared by all evaluated systems. This question is about input type, regardless of number. E.g. if the input is a set of documents, you would still select text: document below. Check-box options (select all that apply): \u25a1 raw/structured data: numerical, symbolic, and other data, possibly structured into trees, graphs, graphical models, etc. May be the input e.g. to Referring Expression Generation (REG), endto-end text generation, etc. NB: excludes linguistic structures. \u25a1 deep linguistic representation (DLR): any of a variety of deep, underspecified, semantic representations, such as abstract meaning representations (AMRs; Banarescu et al., 2013) or discourse representation structures (DRSs; Kamp and Reyle, 2013) . \u25a1 shallow linguistic representation (SLR): any of a variety of shallow, syntactic representations, e.g. Universal Dependency (UD) structures; typically the input to surface realisation. \u25a1 text: subsentential unit of text: a unit of text shorter than a sentence, e.g. Referring Expressions (REs), verb phrase, text fragment of any length; includes titles/headlines. \u25a1 text: sentence: a single sentence (or set of sentences). \u25a1 text: multiple sentences: a sequence of multiple sentences, without any document structure (or a set of such sequences). \u25a1 text: document: a text with document structure, such as a title, paragraph breaks or sections, e.g. a set of news reports for summarisation. \u25a1 text: dialogue: a dialogue of any length, excluding a single turn which would come under one of the other text types. \u25a1 text: other: input is text but doesn't match any of the above text:* categories. \u25a1 speech: a recording of speech. \u25a1 visual: an image or video. \u25a1 multi-modal: catch-all value for any combination of data and/or linguistic representation and/or visual data etc. \u25a1 control feature: a feature or parameter specifically present to control a property of the output text, e.g. positive stance, formality, author style. \u25a1 no input (human generation): human generation 6 , therefore no system inputs. \u25a1 other (please specify): if input is none of the above, choose this option and describe it. Question 2.2: What type of output do the evaluated system(s) generate? Select all that apply. If none match, select 'Other' and describe. Describe the type of output, where output refers to the representations and/or data structures shared by all evaluated systems. This question is about output type, regardless of number. E.g. if the output is a set of documents, you would still select text: document below. Note that the options for outputs are the same as for inputs except that the no input (human generation) option is replaced with human-generated 'outputs', and the control feature option is removed. Check-box options (select all that apply): \u25a1 raw/structured data: numerical, symbolic, and other data, possibly structured into trees, graphs, graphical models, etc. May be the input e.g. to Referring Expression Generation (REG), endto-end text generation, etc. NB: excludes linguistic structures. \u25a1 deep linguistic representation (DLR): any of a variety of deep, underspecified, semantic representations, such as abstract meaning representations (AMRs; Banarescu et al., 2013) or discourse representation structures (DRSs; Kamp and Reyle, 2013) . \u25a1 shallow linguistic representation (SLR): any of a variety of shallow, syntactic representations, e.g. Universal Dependency (UD) structures; typically the input to surface realisation. \u25a1 text: subsentential unit of text: a unit of text shorter than a sentence, e.g. Referring Expressions (REs), verb phrase, text fragment of any length; includes titles/headlines. \u25a1 text: sentence: a single sentence (or set of sentences). \u25a1 text: multiple sentences: a sequence of multiple sentences, without any document structure (or a set of such sequences). \u25a1 text: document: a text with document structure, such as a title, paragraph breaks or sections, e.g. a set of news reports for summarisation. \u25a1 text: dialogue: a dialogue of any length, excluding a single turn which would come under one of the other text types. \u25a1 text: other: select if output is text but doesn't match any of the above text:* categories. \u25a1 speech: a recording of speech. \u25a1 visual: an image or video. \u25a1 multi-modal: catch-all value for any combination of data and/or linguistic representation and/or visual data etc. \u25a1 human-generated 'outputs': manually created stand-ins exemplifying outputs. 6 \u25a1 other (please specify): if output is none of the above, choose this option and describe it. Question 2.3: How would you describe the task that the evaluated system(s) perform in mapping the inputs in Q2.1 to the outputs in Q2.2? Occasionally, more than one of the options below may apply. If none match, select 'Other' and describe. This field records the task performed by the system(s) being evaluated. This is independent of the application domain (financial reporting, weather forecasting, etc.), or the specific method (rulebased, neural, etc.) implemented in the system. We indicate mutual constraints between inputs, outputs and task for some of the options below. Check-box options (select all that apply): \u25a1 content selection/determination: selecting the specific content that will be expressed in the generated text from a representation of possible content. This could be attribute selection for REG (without the surface realisation step). Note that the output here is not text. \u25a1 content ordering/structuring: assigning an order and/or structure to content to be included in generated text. Note that the output here is not text. \u25a1 aggregation: converting inputs (typically deep linguistic representations or shallow linguistic representations) in some way in order to reduce redundancy (e.g. representations for 'they like swimming', 'they like running' \u2192 representation for 'they like swimming and running'). \u25a1 referring expression generation: generating text to refer to a given referent, typically represented in the input as a set of attributes or a linguistic representation. \u25a1 lexicalisation: associating (parts of) an input representation with specific lexical items to be used in their realisation. \u25a1 deep generation: one-step text generation from raw/structured data or deep linguistic representations. One-step means that no intermediate representations are passed from one independently run module to another. \u25a1 surface realisation (SLR to text): one-step text generation from shallow linguistic representations. One-step means that no intermediate representations are passed from one independently run module to another. \u25a1 feature-controlled text generation: generation of text that varies along specific dimensions where the variation is controlled via control features specified as part of the input. Input is a non-textual representation (for featurecontrolled text-to-text generation select the matching text-to-text task). \u25a1 data-to-text generation: generation from raw/structured data which may or may not include some amount of content selection as part of the generation process. Output is likely to be text:* or multi-modal. \u25a1 dialogue turn generation: generating a dialogue turn (can be a greeting or closing) from a representation of dialogue state and/or last turn(s), etc. \u25a1 question generation: generation of questions from given input text and/or knowledge base such that the question can be answered from the input. \u25a1 question answering: input is a question plus optionally a set of reference texts and/or knowledge base, and the output is the answer to the question. \u25a1 paraphrasing/lossless simplification: text-totext generation where the aim is to preserve the meaning of the input while changing its wording. This can include the aim of changing the text on a given dimension, e.g. making it simpler, changing its stance or sentiment, etc., which may be controllable via input features. Note that this task type includes meaningpreserving text simplification (non-meaning preserving simplification comes under compression/lossy simplification below). \u25a1 compression/lossy simplification: text-to-text generation that has the aim to generate a shorter, or shorter and simpler, version of the input text. This will normally affect meaning to some extent, but as a side effect, rather than the primary aim, as is the case in summarisation. \u25a1 machine translation: translating text in a source language to text in a target language while maximally preserving the meaning. \u25a1 summarisation (text-to-text): output is an extractive or abstractive summary of the important/relevant/salient content of the input document(s). \u25a1 end-to-end text generation: use this option if the single system task corresponds to more than one of tasks above, implemented either as separate modules pipelined together, or as one-step generation, other than deep generation and surface realisation. \u25a1 image/video description: input includes visual, and the output describes it in some way. \u25a1 post-editing/correction: system edits and/or corrects the input text (typically itself the textual output from another system) to yield an improved version of the text. \u25a1 other (please specify): if task is none of the above, choose this option and describe it.

A.4 Quality Criterion n -Definition and Operationalisation Questions in this section collect information about the nth quality criterion assessed in the single human evaluation experiment that this sheet is being completed for. A.4.1 Quality criterion properties (Questions 4.1.1-4.1.3) Questions 4.1.1-4.1.3 capture the aspect of quality that is assessed by a given quality criterion in terms of three orthogonal properties. They help determine whether or not the same aspect of quality is being evaluated in different evaluation experiments. The three properties characterise quality criteria in terms of (i) what type of quality is being assessed; (ii) what aspect of the system output is being assessed; and (iii) whether system outputs are assessed in their own right or with reference to some system-internal or system-external frame of reference. For full explanations see Belz et al. (2020) . Question 4.1.1: What type of quality is assessed by the quality criterion? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Correctness: Select this option if it is possible to state, generally for all outputs, the conditions under which outputs are maximally correct (hence of maximal quality). E.g. for Grammaticality, 8 outputs are (maximally) correct if they contain no grammatical errors; for Semantic Completeness, outputs are correct if they express all the content in the input. \u2022 Goodness: Select this option if, in contrast to correctness criteria, there is no single, general mechanism for deciding when outputs are maximally good, only for deciding for any two outputs which is better and which is worse. E.g. for Fluency, even if outputs contain no disfluencies, there may be other ways in which any given output could be more fluent. \u2022 Feature: Choose this option if, in terms of property X captured by the criterion, outputs are not generally better if they are more X, but instead, depending on evaluation context, more X may be either better or worse. E.g. for Specificity, outputs can be more specific or less specific, but it's not the case that outputs are, in the general case, better when they are more specific. Question 4.1.2: Which aspect of system outputs is assessed by the quality criterion? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Form of output: Choose this option if the criterion assesses the form of outputs alone, e.g. Grammaticality is only about the form, a sentence can be grammatical yet be wrong or nonsensical in terms of content. \u2022 Content of output: Select this option if the criterion assesses the content/meaning of the output alone, e.g. Meaning Preservation only assesses content; two sentences can be considered to have the same meaning, but differ in form. \u2022 Both form and content of output: Choose this option if the criterion assesses outputs as a whole, not just form or just content. E.g. Coherence is a property of outputs as a whole, either form or meaning can detract from it. Inherently extrinsic criteria such as Usefulness or Task Completion also fall in this category. Question 4.1.3: Is each output assessed for quality in its own right, or with reference to a system-internal or external frame of reference? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Quality of output in its own right: Select this option if output quality is assessed without referring to anything other than the output itself, i.e. no system-internal or external frame of reference. E.g. Poeticness is assessed by considering (just) the output and how poetic it is. \u2022 Quality of output relative to the input: Choose this option if output quality is assessed relative to the input. E.g. Answerability is the degree to which the output question can be answered from information in the input. \u2022 Quality of output relative to a system-external frame of reference: Choose this option if output quality is assessed with reference to systemexternal information, such as a knowledge base, a person's individual writing style, or the performance of an embedding system. E.g. Factual Accuracy assesses outputs relative to a source of real-world knowledge. Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Objective: Choose this option if the evaluation uses objective assessment, e.g. any automatically counted or otherwise quantified measurements such as mouse-clicks, occurrences in text, etc. Repeated assessments of the same output with an objective-mode evaluation method always yield the same score/result. \u2022 Subjective: Choose this option in all other cases. Subjective assessments involve ratings, opinions and preferences by evaluators. Some criteria lend themselves more readily to subjective assessments, e.g. Friendliness of a conversational agent, but an objective measure e.g. based on lexical markers is also conceivable. Question 4.2.2: Are outputs assessed in absolute or relative terms? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Absolute: Select this option if evaluators are shown outputs from a single system during each individual assessment. \u2022 Relative: Choose this option if evaluators are shown outputs from multiple systems at the same time during assessments, typically ranking or preference-judging them. Question 4.2.3: Is the evaluation intrinsic or extrinsic? Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Intrinsic: Choose this option if quality of outputs is assessed without considering their effect on something external to the system, e.g. the performance of an embedding system or of a user at a task. \u2022 Extrinsic: Choose this option if quality of outputs is assessed in terms of their effect on something external to the system such as the performance of an embedding system or of a user at a task. A Multiple-choice options (select one): 9 \u2022 (dis)agreement with quality statement: Participants specify the degree to which they agree with a given quality statement by indicating their agreement on a rating instrument. The rating instrument is labelled with degrees of agreement and can additionally have numerical labels. E.g. This text is fluent -1=strongly disagree...5=strongly agree. \u2022 direct quality estimation: Participants are asked to provide a rating using a rating instrument, which typically (but not always) mentions the quality criterion explicitly. E.g. How fluent is this text? -1=not at all fluent...5=very fluent. \u2022 relative quality estimation (including ranking): Participants evaluate two or more items in terms of which is better. E.g. Rank these texts in terms of fluency; Which of these texts is more fluent?; Which of these items do you prefer?. \u2022 counting occurrences in text: Evaluators are asked to count how many times some type of phenomenon occurs, e.g. the number of facts contained in the output that are inconsistent with the input. 9 Explanations adapted from Howcroft et al. (2020) . \u2022 qualitative feedback (e.g. via comments entered in a text box): Typically, these are responses to open-ended questions in a survey or interview. \u2022 evaluation through post-editing/annotation: Choose this option if the evaluators' task consists of editing or inserting annotations in text. E.g. evaluators may perform error correction and edits are then automatically measured to yield a numerical score. \u2022 output classification or labelling: Choose this option if evaluators assign outputs to categories. E.g. What is the overall sentiment of this piece of text? -Positive/neutral/negative. \u2022 user-text interaction measurements: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment interact with a text in some way, and measurements are taken of their interaction. E.g. reading speed, eye movement tracking, comprehension questions, etc. Excludes situations where participants are given a task to solve and their performance is measured which comes under the next option. \u2022 task performance measurements: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment are given a task to perform, and measurements are taken of their performance at the task. E.g. task is finding information, and task performance measurement is task completion speed and success rate. \u2022 user-system interaction measurements: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment interact with a system in some way, while measurements are taken of their interaction. E.g. duration of interaction, hyperlinks followed, number of likes, or completed sales. \u2022 Other (please specify): Use the text box to describe the form of response elicitation used in assessing the quality criterion if it doesn't fall in any of the above categories. Question 4.3.9: How are raw responses from participants aggregated or otherwise processed to obtain reported scores for this quality criterion? State if no scores reported. What to enter in the text box: normally a set of separate assessments is collected from evaluators and is converted to the results as reported. Describe here the method(s) used in the conversion(s). E.g. macro-averages or micro-averages are computed from numerical scores to provide summary, persystem results. Question 4.3.10: Method(s) used for determining effect size and significance of findings for this quality criterion. What to enter in the text box: A list of methods used for calculating the effect size and significance of any results, both as reported in the paper given in Question 1.1, for this quality criterion. If none calculated, state 'None'. What to enter in the text box: the methods used to compute, and results obtained from, any measures of inter-annotator and intra-annotator agreement obtained for the quality criterion. A.5 Ethics Questions (Questions 5.1-5.4) The questions in this section relate to ethical aspects of the evaluation. Information can be entered in the text box provided, and/or by linking to a source where complete information can be found. Question 5.1: Has the evaluation experiment this sheet is being completed for, or the larger study it is part of, been approved by a research ethics committee? If yes, which research ethics committee? What to enter in the text box: Typically, research organisations, universities and other highereducation institutions require some form ethical approval before experiments involving human participants, however innocuous, are permitted to proceed. Please provide here the name of the body that approved the experiment, or state 'No' if approval has not (yet) been obtained. Question 5.2: Do any of the system outputs (or human-authored stand-ins) evaluated, or do any of the responses collected, in the experiment contain personal data (as defined in GDPR Art. 4, \u00a71: https://gdpr.eu/article-4-definitions/)? If yes, describe data and state how addressed. What to enter in the text box: State 'No' if no personal data as defined by GDPR was recorded or collected, otherwise explain how conformity with GDPR requirements such as privacy and security was ensured, e.g. by linking to the (successful) application for ethics approval from Question 5.1. Question 5.3: Do any of the system outputs (or human-authored stand-ins) evaluated, or do any of the responses collected, in the experiment contain special category information (as defined in GDPR Art. 9, \u00a71: https://gdpr.eu/article-9-processing-specialcategories-of-personal-data-prohibited/)? If yes, describe data and state how addressed. What to enter in the text box: State 'No' if no special-category data as defined by GDPR was recorded or collected, otherwise explain how conformity with GDPR requirements relating to special-category data was ensured, e.g. by linking to the (successful) application for ethics approval from Question 5.1. Question 5.4: Have any impact assessments been carried out for the evaluation experiment, and/or any data collected/evaluated in connection with it? If yes, summarise approach(es) and outcomes. What to enter in the text box: Use this box to describe any ex ante or ex post impact assessments that have been carried out in relation to the evaluation experiment, such that the assessment plan and process, as well as the outcomes, were captured in written form. Link to documents if possible. Types of impact assessment include data protection impact assessments, e.g. under GDPR. 10 Environmental and social impact assessment frameworks are also available. What to enter in the text box: The number of different response values for this quality criterion. E.g. for a 5-point Likert scale, the size to enter is 5. For two-way forced-choice preference judgments, it is 2; if there's also a no-preference option, enter 3. For a slider that is mapped to 100 different values for the purpose of recording assessments, the size to enter is 100. If no rating instrument is used (e.g. when evaluation gathers post-edits or qualitative feedback only), enter 'N/A'. Question 4.3.4: List or range of possible values of the scale or other rating instrument. Enter 'N/A', if there is no rating instrument. What to enter in the text box: list, or give the range of, the possible values of the rating instrument. The list or range should be of the size specified in Question 4.3.3. If there are too many to list, use a range. E.g. for two-way forced-choice preference judgments, the list entered might be A better, B better; if there's also a no-preference option, the list might be A better, B better, neither. For a slider that is mapped to 100 different values for the purpose of recording assessments, the range 1-100 might be entered. If no rating instrument is used (e.g. when evaluation gathers post-edits or qualitative feedback only), enter 'N/A'.

Multiple-choice options (select one): \u2022 Multiple-choice options: choose this option if evaluators select exactly one of multiple options. \u2022 Check-boxes: choose this option if evaluators select any number of options from multiple given options. \u2022 Slider: choose this option if evaluators move a pointer on a slider scale to the position corresponding to their assessment. \u2022 N/A (there is no rating instrument): choose this option if there is no rating instrument. \u2022 Other (please specify): choose this option if there is a rating instrument, but none of the above adequately describe the way you present it to evaluators. Use the text box to describe the rating instrument and link to a screenshot. Question 4.3.6: If there is no rating instrument, describe briefly what task the evaluators perform (e.g. ranking multiple outputs, finding information, playing a game, etc.), and what information is recorded. Enter 'N/A' if there is a rating instrument. What to enter in the text box: If (and only if) there is no rating instrument, i.e. you entered 'N/A' for Questions 4.3.3-4.3.5, describe the task evaluators",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the Human Evaluation Datasheet (HEDS), a template for recording the details of individual human evaluation experiments in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and reports on first experience of researchers using HEDS sheets in practice. Originally taking inspiration from seminal papers by Bender and Friedman (2018), Mitchell et al. (2019), and Gebru et al. (2020), HEDS facilitates the recording of properties of human evaluations in sufficient detail, and with sufficient standardisation, to support comparability, meta-evaluation, and reproducibility assessments for human evaluations. These are crucial for scientifically principled evaluation, but the overhead of completing a detailed datasheet is substantial, and we discuss possible ways of addressing this and other issues observed in practice.",
