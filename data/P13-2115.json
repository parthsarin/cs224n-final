Inspired from summarization, the method maximizes the coverage of topics that are recognized automatically in transcripts of conversation fragments. The method is evaluated on excerpts of the Fisher and AMI corpora, using a crowdsourcing platform to elicit comparative relevance judgments. The results demonstrate that the method outperforms two competitive baselines. Introduction The goal of keyword extraction from texts is to provide a set of words that are representative of the semantic content of the texts. In the application intended here, keywords are automatically extracted from transcripts of conversation fragments, and are used to formulate queries to a just-in-time document recommender system. It is thus important that the keyword set preserves the diversity of topics from the conversation. While the first keyword extraction methods ignored topicality as they were based on word frequencies, more recent methods have considered topic modeling factors for keyword extraction, but without specifically setting a topic diversity constraint, which is important for naturally-occurring conversations. In this paper, we propose a new method for keyword extraction that rewards both word similarity, to extract the most representative words, and word diversity, to cover several topics if necessary. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review existing methods for keyword extraction. In Section 3 we describe our proposal, which relies on topic modeling and a novel topic-aware diverse keyword extraction algorithm. Section 4 presents the data and tasks for comparing sets of keywords. In Section 5 we show that our method outperforms two existing ones. State of the Art in Keyword Extraction Numerous studies have been conducted to automatically extract keywords from a text or a transcribed conversation. The earliest techniques have used word frequencies (Luhn, 1957) , TFIDF values (Salton et al., 1975; Salton and Buckley, 1988) , and pairwise word co-occurrence frequencies (Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004) to rank words for extraction. These approaches do not consider word meaning, so they may ignore lowfrequency words which together indicate a highlysalient topic (Nenkova and McKeown, 2012) . To improve over frequency-based methods, several ways to use lexical semantic information have been proposed. Semantic relations between words can be obtained from a manuallyconstructed thesaurus such as WordNet, or from Wikipedia, or from an automatically-built thesaurus using latent topic modeling techniques. Ye et al. (2007) used the frequency of all words belonging to the same WordNet concept set, while the Wikifier system (Csomai and Mihalcea, 2007) relied on Wikipedia links to compute a substitute to word frequency. Harwath and Hazen (2012) used topic modeling with PLSA to build a thesaurus, which they used to rank words based on topical similarity to the topics of a transcribed conversation. To consider dependencies among selected words, word co-occurrence has been combined with PageRank by Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) , and additionally with WordNet by Wang et al. (2007) , or with topical information by Z. Liu et al. (2010) . However, as shown empirically by Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) and by Z. Liu et al. (2010) with various co-occurrence windows, such approaches have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies between words related to the same topic. Z. Liu et al. (2009b) used part-of-speech information and word clustering techniques, while F. Liu et al. (2009a) added this information to the TFIDF method so as to consider both word dependency and semantic information. However, although they considered topical similarity, the above methods did not explicitly reward diversity and might miss secondary topics. Supervised methods have been used to learn a model for extracting keywords with various learning algorithms (Turney, 1999; Frank et al., 1999; Hulth, 2003) . These approaches, however, rely on the availability of in-domain training data, and the objective functions they use for learning do not consider yet the diversity of keywords. Diverse Keyword Extraction We propose to build a topical representation of a conversation fragment, and then to select keywords using topical similarity while also rewarding the diversity of topic coverage, inspired by recent summarization methods (Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Li et al., 2012) . Representing Topic Information Topic models such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be used to determine the distribution over the topic z of a word w, noted p(z|w), from a large amount of training documents. LDA implemented in the Mallet toolkit (McCallum, 2002) is used in this paper because it does not suffer from the overfitting issue of PLSA (Blei et al., 2003) . The distribution of each topic z in a given conversation fragment t, noted p(z|t), can be computed by summing over all probabilities p(z|w) of the N words w spoken in the fragment: p(z|t) = 1 N w\u2208t p(z|w). Selecting Keywords The problem of keyword extraction with maximal topic coverage is formulated as follows. If a conversation fragment t mentions a set of topics Z, and each word w from the fragment t can evoke a subset of the topics in Z, then the goal is to find a subset of unique words S \u2286 t, with |S| \u2264 k, which maximzes the number of covered topics for each number of keywords k. This problem is an instance of the maximum coverage problem, which is N P -hard. Nemhauser et al. (1978) showed that a greedy algorithm can find an approximate solution guaranteed to be within (1 \u2212 1 e ) 0.63 of the optimal solution if the coverage function is submodular and monotone nondecreasing 1 . To find a monotone submodular function for keyword extraction, we used inspiration from recent work on extractive summarization methods (Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Li et al., 2012) , which proposed a square root function for diverse selection of sentences to cover the maximum number of key concepts of a given document. The function rewards diversity by increasing the gain of selecting a sentence including a concept that was not yet covered by a previously selected sentence. This must be adapted for keyword extraction by defining an appropriate reward function. We first introduce r S,z , the topical similarity with respect to topic z of the keyword set S selected from the fragment t, defined as follows: r S,z = w\u2208S p(z|w) \u2022 p(z|t). We then propose the following reward function for each topic, where p(z|t) is the importance of the topic and \u03bb is a parameter between 0 and 1: f : r S,z \u2192 p(z|t) \u2022 r \u03bb S,z . This is clearly a submodular function with diminishing returns as r S,z increases. Finally, the keywords S \u2286 t, with |S| \u2264 k, are chosen by maximizing the cumulative reward function over all the topics, formulated as follows: R(S) = z\u2208Z p(z|t) \u2022 r \u03bb S,z . Since R(S) is submodular, the greedy algorithm for maximizing R(S) is shown as Algorithm 1 on the next page, with r {w},z being similar to r S,z with S = {w}. If \u03bb = 1, the reward function is linear and only measures the topical similarity of words with the main topics of t. However, when 0 < \u03bb < 1, as soon as a word is selected from a topic, other words from the same topic start having diminishing gains. Data and Evaluation Method The proposed keyword extraction method was tested on two conversational corpora, the Fisher Figure 1 : Example of a HIT based on an AMI discussion about the impact on sales of some features of remote controls (the conversation transcript is given in the Appendix). The word cloud was generated using Wordle TM from the list produced by the diverse keyword extraction method with \u03bb = 0.75 (noted D(.75)) for image (a) and by a topic similarity method (TS) for image (b). TS over-represents the topic \"color\" by selecting three words related to it, but misses other topics such as \"remote control\", \"losing a device\" and \"buying a device\" which are also representative of the fragment. Corpus (Cieri et al., 2004) , and the AMI Meeting Corpus (Carletta, 2007) . The former corpus contains about 11,000 topic-labeled telephone conversations, on 40 pre-selected topics (one per conversation). We created a topic model using Mallet over two thirds of the Fisher Corpus, given its large number of single-topic documents, with 40 topics. The remaining data is used to build 11 artificial \"conversations\" (1-2 minutes long) for testing, by concatenating 11 times three fragments about three different topics. The AMI Corpus contains 171 half-hour meetings about remote control design, which include several topics each -so they cannot be directly used for learning topic models. While selecting for testing 8 conversation fragments of 2-3 minutes each, we trained topic models on a subset of the English Wikipedia (10% or 124,684 articles). Following several previous studies, the number of topics was set to 100 (Boyd-Graber et al., 2009; Hoffman et al., 2010) . To evaluate the relevance (or representativeness) of extracted keywords with respect to a conversation fragment, we designed comparison tasks. In each task, a fragment is shown, followed by three control questions about its content, and then by two lists of nine keywords each, from two different extraction methods. To improve readability, the keyword lists are presented to the judges using a word cloud representation generated by Wordle TM (http://www.wordle.net), in which the words ranked higher are emphasized in the word cloud (see example in Figure 1 ). The judges had to read the conversation transcript, answer the control questions, and then decide which word cloud better represents the content of the conversation. The tasks were crowdsourced via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) as \"human intelligence tasks\" (HITs). One of them is exemplified in Figure 1 , without the control questions, and the respective conversation transcript is given in the Appendix. Ten workers were recruited for each corpus. An example of judgment counts for each of the 8 AMI HITs comparing two methods is shown in Table 1 . After collecting judgments, the comparative relevance values were computed by first applying a qualification control factor to the human judgments, and then averaging results over all judgments (Habibi and Popescu-Belis, 2012) . Moreover, to verify the diversity of the key- word set, we use the \u03b1-NDCG measure (Clarke et al., 2008) proposed for information retrieval, which rewards a mixture of relevance and diversity -with equal weights when \u03b1 = .5 as set here. We only apply \u03b1-NDCG to the three-topic conversation fragments from the Fisher Corpus, relevance of a keyword being set to 1 when it belongs to the fragment corresponding to the topic. A higher value indicates that keywords are more uniformly distributed across the three topics. Experimental Results We have compared several versions of the diverse keyword extraction method, noted D(\u03bb), for \u03bb \u2208 {.5, .75, 1}, with two other methods. The first one uses only word frequency (not including stopwords) and is noted WF. We did not use TFIDF because it sets low weights on keywords that are repeated in many fragments but which are nevertheless important to extract. The second method is based on topical similarity (noted TS) but does not specifically enforce diversity (Harwath and Hazen, 2012) . In fact TS coincides with D(1), so it is noted TS. As the relevance of keywords for D(.5) was already quite low, we did not test lower values of \u03bb. Similarly, we did not test additional values of \u03bb above .5 because the resulting word lists were very similar to tested values. First of all, we compared the four methods with respect to the diversity constraint over the con- catenated fragments of the Fisher Corpus, by using \u03b1-NDCG to measure how evenly the extracted keywords were distributed across the three topics. HIT A B C D E F G H TS more relevant 4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 D(. Figure 2 shows results averaged over 11 conversations for various sizes of the keyword set (1-15). The average \u03b1-NDCG values for D(.75) and D(.5) are similar, and clearly higher than WF and TS for all ranks (except, of course, for a single keyword). The values for TS are quite low, and only increase for a large number of keywords, demonstrating that TS does not cope well with topic diversity, but on the contrary first selects keywords from the dominant topic. The values for WF are more uniform as it does not consider topics at all. To measure the overall representativeness of keywords, we performed binary comparisons between the outputs of each method, using crowdsourcing, over 11 fragments from the Fisher Corpus and 8 fragments from AMI. The goal is to rank the methods, so we only report here on the comparisons required for complete ordering. AMT workers compared two lists of nine keywords each, with four options: X more representative or relevant than Y , or vice-versa, or both relevant, or both irrelevant. Table 1 shows the judgments collected when comparing the output of D(.75) with TS on the AMI Corpus. Workers disagreed for the first two HITs, but then found that the keywords extracted by D(.75) were more representative compared to TS. The consolidated rel-evance (Habibi and Popescu-Belis, 2012 ) is 78% for D(.75) vs. 22% for TS. The averaged relevance values for all comparisons needed to rank the four methods are shown in Table 2 separately for the Fisher and AMI Corpora. Although the exact differences vary, the human judgments over the two corpora both indicate the following ranking: D(.75) > TS > WF > D(.5). The optimal value of \u03bb is thus around .75, and with this value, our diversity-aware method extracts more representative keyword sets than TS and WF. The differences between methods are larger for the Fisher Corpus, due to the artificial fragments that concatenate three topics, but they are still visible on the natural fragments of the AMI Corpus. The low scores of D(.5) are found to be due, upon inspection, to the low relevance of keywords. In particular, the comparative relevance of D(.75) vs. D(.5) on the Fisher Corpus is very large (96% vs. 4%). Conclusion The diverse keyword extraction method with \u03bb = .75 provides the keyword sets that are judged most representative of the conversation fragments (two conversational datasets) by a large number of human judges recruited via AMT, and has the highest \u03b1-NDCG value. Therefore, enforcing both relevance and diversity brings an effective improvement to keyword extraction. Setting \u03bb for a new dataset remains an issue, and requires a small development data set. However, preliminary experiments with a third dataset showed that \u03bb = .75 remains a good value. In the future, we will use keywords to retrieve documents from a repository and recommend them to conversation participants by formulating topically-separate queries. Appendix: Conversation transcript of AMI ES2005a meeting (00:00:5-00:01:52) The following transcript of a four-party conversations (speakers noted A through D) was submitted to our keyword extraction method and a baseline one, generating respectively the two word clouds shown in Figure 1 . A: The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic. So uh D: Yeah. Yeah. C: Mm-hmm. D: Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah. So presumably that might be an idea to C: Yeah the universal ones. A: Yeah, yeah. C: Mm. Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black. As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour? Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least. Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things? D: Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. The the keyrings, yeah yeah. Okay, that's cool. C: Because we always lose our remote control. B: Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices? What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market. D: Okay. B: So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices. They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
