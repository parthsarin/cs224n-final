It specifically focuses on contact-induced semantic shifts in Quebec English. We contrast synchronic data from different regions in order to identify the meanings that are specific to Quebec and potentially related to language contact. Type-level embeddings are used to detect new semantic shifts, and token-level embeddings to isolate regionally specific occurrences. We introduce a new 80-item test set and conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. We demonstrate that diachronic word embedding methods can be applied to contactinduced semantic shifts observed in synchrony, obtaining results comparable to the state of the art on similar tasks in diachrony. However, we show that encouraging evaluation results do not translate to practical value in detecting new semantic shifts. Finally, our application of token-level embeddings accelerates manual data exploration and provides an efficient way of scaling up sociolinguistic analyses. Introduction A growing body of work has investigated semantic change detection, mainly relying on word embedding methods to model differences in meaning over time. This has been presented as a promising new approach for descriptive linguistics, providing the means to test theoretical hypotheses and discover new cases of semantic change on a large scale (Tahmasebi et al., 2021) . However, it has also been pointed out that existing work has largely focused on generic research questions and datasets, using them as a training ground for proof-of-concept studies (Boleda, 2020) . As a result, many reported instances of semantic change are either long established (e.g. gay shifting from 'happy' to 'homosexual') or are of otherwise limited importance (e.g. proper names reflecting sociohistorical context). But how useful are semantic change detection methods when applied to a precisely defined descriptive issue? We use them to investigate contactinduced semantic shifts, focusing specifically on Quebec English. Semantic influence of French is documented in the sociolinguistic literature on Quebec (e.g. deception 'disappointment', cf. Fr. d\u00e9ception), but mostly from a qualitative standpoint, with the importance of the phenomenon still under debate. This reflects known methodological challenges in studying lexical variation, which is precisely what our approach aims to overcome. We follow common sociolinguistic practice and use synchronic data, contrasting Quebec with predominantly English-speaking Canadian regions. Drawing on a large Twitter corpus, we implement a two-pronged approach: we use type-level embeddings to detect new semantic shifts, and token-level embeddings to isolate regionally specific occurrences of target lexical items. We conduct standard quantitative evaluation and extensive qualitative analyses, focusing on the descriptive relevance of the results and challenges arising from empirically occurring data. We provide the following contributions: \u2022 we demonstrate that diachronic word embedding methods can be applied to contactinduced semantic shifts observed in synchrony. We validate these approaches using a new 80-item test set, obtaining results comparable to the state of the art on similar semantic change detection tasks in diachrony; \u2022 we show that encouraging evaluation results do not translate to practical value in detecting new semantic shifts, mainly due to the rarity of the phenomenon and noise in the results; \u2022 we illustrate the utility of token-level embeddings in identifying regionally specific occurrences. Our approach accelerates manual data exploration and provides an efficient way of scaling up sociolinguistic analyses. This paper is organized as follows. We first provide a brief overview of related work ( \u00a7 2) and introduce the corpus and the test set ( \u00a7 3). We then present two experiments, the first using type-level embeddings to detect new cases of semantic change ( \u00a7 4), and the second using token-level embeddings to investigate the individual senses of target lexical items ( \u00a7 5). We finally outline key conclusions and directions for future work ( \u00a7 6). Related work Semantic change detection methods developed in recent years have often relied on vector space models (Kutuzov et al., 2018) , where meaning is represented as a vector reflecting the target word's cooccurrence patterns. The general approach consists in training models specific to different time periods and then quantifying the distance between a word's vectors in different models. The same principle can be applied to semantic differences across regions, text types, and so on. Specific implementations include creating separate count-based models while maintaining the same linguistic contexts across time periods (Gulordava and Baroni, 2011) or training neural word embeddings in a way that that captures meaning change while ensuring comparability between vector spaces (Dubossarsky et al., 2019; Hamilton et al., 2016b; Kim et al., 2014) . Semantic change is usually quantified using the cosine distance between a word's vectors in different models, but alternative measures have also been proposed (Hamilton et al., 2016a) . More recently, pretrained neural networks have been used to obtain contextual embeddings and detect change by computing average representations for different time periods or measuring differences in clustering patterns (Giulianelli et al., 2020; Martinc et al., 2020a,b) . Similar work has been done on synchronic data, but it is considerably more limited. It has focused on issues such as semantic variation across online communities of practice (Del Tredici and Fern\u00e1ndez, 2017 ), text types (Fi\u0161er and Ljube\u0161i\u0107, 2018) , large dialect regions (Kulkarni et al., 2016) , and different languages (Uban et al., 2019) . Evaluation of these methods is challenging and is often limited to a qualitative analysis of a restricted number of examples. Quantitative evaluations have involved background information from lexicographic sources (Basile and McGillivray, 2018) or synthetic corpora (Shoemark et al., 2019) . While their focus is on the top semantic change candidates output by a model, an alternative approach consists in using manually annotated datasets containing (usually several dozen) words whose meaning is either stable or subject to change (Basile et al., 2020; Del Tredici et al., 2019; Gulordava and Baroni, 2011; Schlechtweg et al., 2019 Schlechtweg et al., , 2020)) . The words are associated with binary labels or semantic change scores, and the models are evaluated on a ranking or binary classification task. Descriptively oriented studies have used these methods to test theoretical hypotheses, as in the evaluation of two competing laws of semantic change by Xu and Kemp (2015) , or to facilitate exploratory analyses by domain experts. For instance, Rodda et al. ( 2017 ) used vector space models for Ancient Greek to detect semantic shift candidates and then analyzed their nearest neighbors to establish meaning change. De Pascale (2019) studied regional lexical variation in Dutch using token-level models to identify cases where competing words were used with equivalent meanings. Computational work on sociolinguistic issues uses social media posts or other large corpora to detect lexical innovations and dialect regions (Donoso and S\u00e1nchez, 2017; Eisenstein, 2018; Grieve et al., 2018) or to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors (Bamman et al., 2014; Blodgett et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2013) . Language contact has been addressed in terms of codeswitching (Bullock et al., 2019; Guzman et al., 2016) , language choice (Eleta and Golbeck, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015) , and semantic integration of loanwords (Deng et al., 2019; Serigos, 2017; Takamura et al., 2017) . Related work on Canadian English is limited to corpus construction (Cook and Brinton, 2017; Miletic et al., 2020) and descriptive analyses of online communication (Tagliamonte and Denis, 2008) . We are unaware of any computational studies of regional variation in Canadian English, or of contact-induced semantic shifts in inherited (i.e. non-borrowed) lexical items. 3 Data for contact-induced semantic shifts in Quebec English The presence of contact-induced semantic shifts in Quebec English has been reported in a series of sociolinguistic surveys (Boberg, 2012; McArthur, 1989; Rouaud, 2019) and manual corpus analyses (Fee, 1991 (Fee, , 2008;; Grant, 2010; Josselin, 2001) . They have described around 60 English words at-tested in Quebec with meanings typical of formally or semantically similar French words. This phenomenon involves the introduction of a new sense into a word's polysemic structure through innovative meaning change (Koch, 2016) driven by semantic interference in bilinguals (cf. Romaine, 1995) . While this process can be observed over time, we adopt a synchronic perspective. Our assumption is that contact-induced semantic shifts correspond to words whose sense distributions are different in Quebec, a majority French-speaking province, compared to predominantly English-speaking Canadian regions. This is a typical comparative sociolinguistic approach (Tagliamonte, 2002) : we contrast speech communities to identify linguistic behaviors which mirror the differences in their composition. In this section, we introduce the data needed to implement our approach: a large corpus of tweets allowing us to analyze different Canadian regions, and a new test set used to tune our models and validate their performance. Corpus We use a previously created corpus of Canadian English tweets published by users from Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver (Miletic et al., 2020) . Unlike other corpora of Canadian English, it is both sufficiently large for data-intensive methods such as word embeddings, and it contains information on the regional origin and authors of individual tweets. This structure allows us to identify usage patterns that differentiate Montreal from other parts of Canada. It also allows us to distinguish contact phenomena from unrelated types of variation, such as regional trends that are not driven by Montreal (which can be identified using the two control regions) and strong idiolectal preferences (which we can isolate by tracing individual speakers). The data were collected from January to November 2019 by identifying users from the three cities and then crawling their Twitter profiles. The tweets were filtered for geographic origin and language, and near-duplicates posted by individual users were automatically removed. In addition to these preprocessing decisions applied to the original corpus, we introduced additional filtering for the experiments presented in this paper. First, we removed the content posted before 2016 in order to limit the likelihood of picking up diachronic effects; the tweets in the original corpus date back to 2006. In determining the cut-off point, our aim was to find 54, 726 11, 318, 184 193, 228, 246 Toronto 51, 245 12, 465, 659 222, 508, 471 Vancouver 47, 697 11, 381, 080 213, 200, 523 Total 153, 668 35, 164, 923 628, 937, 240 Table 1 : Corpus structure the most reasonable trade-off between a reduction in time span and the remaining amount of data. We then excluded all users with fewer than 10 tweets in the corpus. A maximum of 1,000 tweets per user were retained, with random subsampling performed where this was exceeded. This ensured that the corpus was not dominated by very few highly active individuals: an average of 229 tweets were retained per user, with the top 1% of users accounting for 4% of tweets. The corpus was tokenized and POS tagged using twokenize (Gimpel et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013) and lemmatized using the NLTK WordNet lemmatizer (Bird et al., 2009) . The final corpus is presented in Table 1 . Test set We introduce a new test set allowing for a systematic evaluation of semantic shift detection in the context of English-French language contact. Similarly to recent shared tasks on diachronic data (Basile et al., 2020; Schlechtweg et al., 2020) , we formulate the task as a binary classification problem. The items in the test set are accordingly labeled as semantic shifts or stable words. We include 80 items; this is comparable to the diachronic test sets of which we are aware, containing between 18 and 100 items. We first identify a set of positive examples, starting from a list of candidates based on the literature on Quebec English (Boberg, 2012; Fee, 1991 Fee, , 2008;; Grant, 2010; Josselin, 2001; McArthur, 1989; Rouaud, 2019) . Any items with fewer than 100 occurrences per subcorpus are excluded. A concordance-based analysis is then used to determine if the items present at least one contact-related occurrence in the Montreal subcorpus; those that do not are also excluded. This leaves us with a list of 40 semantic shifts, whose mean frequency in the entire corpus is 5,268 (min = 345, max = 97,188) . We then select 40 stable words, aiming to limit the probability of using items with formally similar French equivalents, as they are more likely to be involved in contact-induced semantic change. We therefore start from a list of 3,231 English words of Anglo-Saxon origin, 1 around half of which meet the frequency threshold (100 per subcorpus). For each of the 40 semantic shifts, we identify a word in the list which is of the same part of speech and is the closest to it in terms of frequency measured on the whole corpus. Using a sample of occurrences, we then verify that the words are not affected by meaning variation across subcorpora or other issues which could bias subsequent analyses (homography, use in proper names etc.). If necessary, we replace them with the word which is the next closest in frequency. Sample items are presented in Table 2 ; the entire test set is publicly available. 2  Note that most recent diachronic test sets were created through costly annotation campaigns, whereas we rely on expert judgment, similarly to some existing work (e.g. McGillivray et al., 2019; Perrone et al., 2019) . This is a viable approach because the phenomenon under study is more specific than general semantic change over time, and its existence can be reliably established based on the sociolinguistic literature, lexicographic sources, and observation of corpus data. In addition, our test set only uses binary labels, so our decisions are comparatively straightforward. Detecting semantic shift candidates We first examine contact-induced semantic shifts from an exploratory perspective. Our aim is to determine which words, within the entire vocabulary, have the most different overall meanings in Montreal compared to Toronto and Vancouver. This section introduces the experimental setup, presents the results of an evaluation used to find the best performing model, and examines the results it obtains on the detection of semantic shift candidates. Experimental setup We implement an approach based on type-level word embeddings, which multiple shared tasks on diachronic data have shown to be robust and to strongly outperform more recent token-level approaches (Basile et al., 2020; Schlechtweg et al., 2020) . Given the specifics of our work -synchronic variation rather than diachronic change, cross-linguistic influence -we experiment with several parameters which may influence model performance depending on datasets and tasks. Meaning representations. We use word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) to train vector space models using the skip-gram architecture with negative sampling (SGNS). We experiment with different vector dimensions (100, 300) and context window sizes (2, 5, 10), and we set the minimum word frequency to 100 in each subcorpus. We use the default values for other parameters, and set the negative sampling rate to 5, the subsampling rate to 10 -3 , and the number of iterations to 5. In order to control for word embedding instability (Pierrejean and Tanguy, 2018) , we train three models for each configuration. Comparing regional subcorpora. We experiment with two approaches used to compare meaning representations from different subcorpora. In the first approach, we train individual word embedding models for each regional subcorpus. Since the resulting models do not share the same vector space, they need to be aligned so that they can be directly compared. We do so using Orthogonal Procrustes (OP) in the implementation first introduced by Hamilton et al. (2016b) , which corresponds to finding the optimal rotational alignment for each pair of matrices. As suggested by Schlechtweg et al. (2019) , we mean-center the matrix columns before alignment. In the second approach, we train a single word embedding model using the entire corpus. Target words are tagged so as to be specific to the subcorpus in which they appear, while context words are the same across the subcorpora. As a result, the meaning representations are specific to each region, but they share the same vector space and are directly comparable. This corresponds to the Temporal Referencing method, which was introduced in diachronic studies with the aim of limiting noise in model alignment (Dubossarsky et al., 2019) . For clarity, we will refer to this method as Spatial Referencing (SR) given the focus of our work. The OP models are trained using gensim ( \u0158eh\u016f\u0159ek and Sojka, 2010), and the SR models using word2vecf (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) . Measuring differences in meaning. Following common practice, we use cosine distance (CD) to measure semantic differences. We compute the CD for a word w in subcorpora a and b as follows: CD(wa, w b ) = n i=1 CD( wa i , w b i ) n for n = 3 runs of the SGNS model, where w a i is the word's vector corresponding to the subcorpus a in the i th run. We then compute the variation score: var(w) = CD(wm, wt) + CD(wm, wv) 2 \u2212 CD(wt, wv) where w m , w t , and w v are the word's representations in the Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver subcorpora. The score prioritizes the words whose meaning in Montreal differs from Toronto and Vancouver, but remains similar in those two cities. Finding the best performing model We begin by evaluating the overall performance of model configurations on the previously introduced test set. This allows us to tune the models as well as to validate their performance relative to the results reported on other similar tasks. Since we focus on the general patterns captured by the models, we use a simple classification based on the median variation score: we compute the score for the 80 words in the test set and consider that the 40 words with the highest score represent semantic shifts, whereas the others are stable. 3 The best performing configuration (Orthogonal Procrustes, 100-dimensional vectors, window size of 5) obtains an accuracy score of 0.8. This is an improvement of 0.175 points compared to the worst result, which confirms the interest of datasetspecific model tuning on this task. Key results are outlined in Table 3 ; accuracy for all tested models is provided in Appendix A. Comprehensive evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper, but we briefly overview the main takeaways. (i) The 100-dimension models strongly outperform the 300-dimension models, in line with Pra\u017e\u00e1k et al.'s (2020) (ii) Smaller window sizes perform somewhat better, in line with synchronic work on German (Schlechtweg et al., 2019) . (iii) The alignments are roughly comparable, with OP obtaining the best individual result and SR the higher mean score. The highest accuracy score we obtain is comparable to the state of the art on other semantic change detection tasks. In addition to indicating the best individual configuration, this validates the general setup of our experiment, confirming that a clear regional regional distinction is present in our data in relation to the semantic influence of French. Deploying the model We now turn to the discovery of semantic shift candidates from the whole vocabulary using the best performing model configuration. Since our aim is to examine its performance on empirically occurring data for potentially ongoing language change, we manually analyze the contexts in which the candidates appear rather than using external information or synthetic corpora. We calculate the variation score for the whole vocabulary (open classes only, i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs), and select the 50 words with the highest score; they are presented in Appendix B. We verify for each word (i) whether it presents a regionally specific use in the Montreal subcorpus, and (ii) whether this use can be explained by the influence of French, and specifically the presence of an equivalent sense in a formally or semantically similar French word, as established by lexicographic sources. 4 This allows us to compute precision; we do not compute recall as it would require a manual analysis of the entire vocabulary. We find that only one candidate clearly corresponds to a contact-induced semantic shift, which translates to a precision score of 0.02. The positive example is the noun exposition (var = 0.22, ranked 26th); it usually refers to an art exhibition in the Montreal subcorpus, and to narrative structure in the two other subcorpora. The meanings are respectively illustrated by examples 1 and 2: 1. I really want to go to an art museum or an art exposition 2. I found the first 2 episodes a little slow, but it does pick up once the exposition is done with The contact-related sense is typical of the French homograph exposition 'exhibition'. This use has been previously described (Fee, 1991) , and it is included in our test set. The contrast between the accuracy on the test set and the precision on the discovery task is striking. Figure 1 shows that the problem lies in the fact that the lexical items of interest, like those in the test set, are not the ones with the most extreme variation scores. They tend to have higher variation scores than stable words, showing that the model does capture meaningful trends. But relevant results are ultimately obscured by other types of variation. False positives include proper names denoting local referents (plateau referring to Plateau-Mont-Royal, a Montreal neighborhood); topical variation (detached limited to real estate in Toronto and Vancouver, which have notoriously tight housing markets); French homographs in code-switched tweets (pour 'for'); misspellings indicative of an imperfect command of English (trough 'through'). While some of these issues have been reported in previous diachronic studies (e.g. referential effects in Del Tredici et al., 2019) , our results underscore that they are highly widespread even when model configurations are carefully tuned. It is tempting to say that they could easily be avoided using basic data filtering, such as the exclusion of the words attested in French corpora or the use of additional frequency thresholds. But things are more complicated than that: for instance, homography also affects many longstanding borrowings (bureau) and targeted semantic shifts (exposition); higher relative frequency in Montreal may reflect noise as well as increased use of a word that has undergone semantic change. It is also not viable to keep extending the list of top Characterizing semantic shifts in context A key limitation of the approach we introduced in the previous section is that it is sense-agnostic: all contexts in which a word appears are grouped into a single vector. Although it can capture meaningful general trends, it is limited in accounting for rare phenomena, which may be troublesome when analyzing language change. This process is not abrupt; rather, it involves a period of coexistence of a new linguistic behavior with the old one (Weinreich et al., 1968) , which for semantic change implies gradual modifications to the polysemic structure of the word (Traugott, 2017) . We therefore expect contact-related senses to appear in a limited number of occurrences per word. We further expect them to be attested in similar immediate contexts, but to be dispersed throughout the corpus. These assumptions, coupled with the previously outlined issues with type-level analyses, suggest that manual inspection of corpus data remains necessary to reliably identify semantic shifts. In order to facilitate this process, we implement a system which allows us to automatically group semantically similar occurrences of a target word and identify the uses that are specific to Montreal. This portraits in honour of Janet Werner's upcoming exposition at the museum . Starting November 10th , every (1) Collection \" Come to admire Laura Granata's exposition at #CLDV Such a beautiful exposition !!! #mbam #art #montrealmuseum space will be turned into a citizens' area with exposition space and multipurpose room . #CJAD #polmtl ( 2 enables us to manually analyze batches of occurrences all at once, rather than examining them one at a time, which streamlines both the discovery of contact-related uses and the exclusion of false positives. In the remainder of this section, we present the experimental setup, a sample analysis of clustered data, and the overall patterns for 40 semantic shifts that were manually annotated using this approach. Experimental setup We produce contextual meaning representations, reflecting differences in the use of individual occurrences. We then group them into clusters in order to identify regionally specific patterns. Token-level embeddings. We use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) , a Transformer-based language model, to produce token-level embeddings. We use the HuggingFace implementation (Wolf et al., 2020) of bert-base-uncased, a 12-layer, 768-dimension version of the model pretrained on English data. No fine-tuning is performed given its computational cost and the assumption that word senses are reflected by differences in context which the pretrained model should be able to capture. For each analyzed word, we extract the tweets in which it appears in all three subcorpora. In order to limit processing and memory requirements, we retain no more than 1,000 total occurrences per word, and use a random sample for more frequent items. We feed each tweet as a single sequence into BERT, which then produces context-informed embeddings for each token in the tweet. We extract the representations for the target word and average over the last 4 hidden layers to obtain a single contextual embedding, similarly to other recent studies (e.g. Laicher et al., 2021) . BERT's tokenizer splits out-of-vocabulary words into subparts with known representations; when this occurs, we average over the subparts to produce a single embedding. Clustering. We identify a word's similar uses by clustering its contextual embeddings using affinity propagation, which performed well in other semantic change studies (e.g. Martinc et al., 2020b) . We use the scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation with default parameters. Analyzing regional use. We consider the clusters containing at least five tweets, and retain them if more than half of the tweets were published in Montreal. This is because we are interested in the senses which are clearly more frequent in Montreal than elsewhere, but which may occasionally appear in other regions. We retain up to 10 such clusters per item, starting with those with the highest proportion of Montreal tweets. We then manually annotate the data for the 40 semantic shifts included in the test set. We use binary labels, and establish if a cluster presents a contact-related sense based on the majority usage in it. More specifically, a target word's use is annotated as contact-related if it fulfills the criterion we previously defined: it must be regionally specific to Montreal and potentially explained by the influence of French. The clusters affected by the issues observed in type-level analyses -referential effects, topical variation, French homographs -are not considered as contact-related. (See Section 4.3 for more details on both the positive and negative criteria.) Neither do we annotate as contact-related the clusters involving structural patterns (e.g. the target word is used with different senses but systematically appears in the tweet-initial or tweet-final position) or those where no reliable determination can be made (e.g. short or ambiguous tweets). Exploring clusters of tweets On average, 8 clusters per word (min = 3, max = 10) were retained for annotation. The mean number of tweets per cluster for a given word stands on average at 13 (min = 8, max = 20). The sample clusters for exposition shown in Table 4 illustrate several types of usage that are frequently grouped together. Cluster 1 contains straightforward examples of contact-induced semantic shifts, which in this case refer to art exhibitions. This is the sense previously illustrated by example 1 in Section 4.3. Cluster 2 shows the effect of this usage on a specific collocational pattern (exposition space / hall), indicating further diffusion of the semantic shift. Cluster 3 reflects noise in the results: exposition is attested as its French homograph in code-switched tweets (in which most text is in English, explaining why they were tagged as English and retained during corpus creation). Additional sample clusters are provided in Appendix C. As these examples illustrate, the clusters are largely homogeneous. Although some are occasionally difficult to interpret, e.g. due to the influence of orthographic information on BERT's representations, this is overall rare. A 15-word sample was annotated by two annotators in order to test the reliability of the general procedure, obtaining a reasonably high Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.55. The utility of this approach is confirmed by the fact that it enabled us to identify at least one contact-related cluster for each of the 40 target items. From a practical standpoint, using clusterlevel annotations was an order of magnitude faster than analyzing individual tweets. This is due to the lower number of required decisions and the comparative ease in determining the meaning of a larger number of similar examples appearing together. Patterns of semantic change We analyze general trends in the annotated data in order to determine if they are related to the variation scores established using type-level models. We specifically focus on two issues that may limit the performance of type-level models: (i) if a contactrelated use concerns a minority of occurrences, it is unlikely to be captured by word2vec; (ii) if it is frequent but not regionally specific, if will not be reflected by our variation score. We compute two corresponding measures: (i) the proportion of tweets, out of all annotated tweets, which appear in clusters that are tagged as contact-related; and (ii) the proportion of tweets, out of all tweets in the clusters that are tagged as contact-related, which originate from the Montreal subcorpus. The results plotted in Figure 2 point to two overarching tendencies. On the one hand, several se-Figure 2 : Scatter plot of annotated words. Y-axis: proportion of tweets that were tagged as contact-related (out of all annotated tweets). X-axis: proportion of tweets from the Montreal subcorpus (out of all tweets tagged as contact-related). Marker size reflects the total number of tweets that were tagged as contact-related. Color coding indicates the variation score computed on type-level models. mantic shifts (definitively 'definitely', exposition 'exhibition' etc.) are characterized by a high proportion of contact-related tweets and, among those, a high proportion of tweets from Montreal. This is indicative of overwhelming contact-related influence which is moreover regionally specific. On the other hand, a larger number of examples (circulation 'traffic', animator 'group leader' etc.) present limited contact-related usage which additionally varies in terms of regional specificity. The annotation-based measures are weakly correlated with the type-level variation score (\u03c1 = 0.23 for both measures), as well as with one another (\u03c1 = \u22120.13). This reflects contrasting patterns, like in the case of entourage, which has a large number of contact-related tweets and a low type-level variation score (\u22120.02, ranked 39th out of the 40 items). This is related to the relatively small difference between the conventional sense 'people attending an important person' and the contact-induced sense 'group of friends, family'. The distinction is immediately apparent to the annotator, but it is often underpinned by referential knowledge rather than differences in distributional contexts. Compare this with the adjective grave, which has a high type-level variation score (0.12, ranked 6th), but appears in few contact-related clusters. This is due to most of its clusters being excluded because they involve its French homograph, as in the expression ce n'est pas grave 'it doesn't matter'. However, the use of French implies drastic distributional differences which are easily captured by type-level models. Conclusion In this study, we applied embedding-based semantic change detection methods to a new set of experimental conditions. Focusing on the descriptive relevance of the results, we developed an 80-item test set for English-French language contact, and manually annotated corpus data for 40 lexical items. Our results demonstrate that current type-level methods are of limited practical use in detecting new semantic shifts: despite robust performance on standard quantitative evaluation, they obtain very low precision on the discovery task. We further implemented a token-level analysis of the individual senses with which target items are used. This accelerated manual data exploration, leading to a detailed account of the issues impacting type-level methods. These results more generally represent the first quantitative corpus-based analysis of contact-induced semantic shifts in Quebec English. Our work also has more general implications, which reaffirm the central role of evaluation practices and corpora in advancing computational analyses of semantic change (Hengchen et al., 2021) . The comparison of evaluations on the test set and on the discovery task underscored the stark difference between the two approaches. This should be taken into account when choosing evaluation methods, especially where the aim is to establish practical usability. And while some reported issues are specific to our corpus, similar problems may affect other semantic change studies, as noisy datasets and complex sense distributions are not unique to our work. Finally, the comparison of type-level and token-level analyses highlighted diverging trends in the data which indicate that semantic shifts involve multiple dimensions of varia-tion. Future work should therefore aim to identify different types of semantic change in addition to quantifying its presence.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the applicability of semantic change detection methods in descriptively oriented linguistic research. It specifically focuses on contact-induced semantic shifts in Quebec English. We contrast synchronic data from different regions in order to identify the meanings that are specific to Quebec and potentially related to language contact. Type-level embeddings are used to detect new semantic shifts, and token-level embeddings to isolate regionally specific occurrences. We introduce a new 80-item test set and conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. We demonstrate that diachronic word embedding methods can be applied to contactinduced semantic shifts observed in synchrony, obtaining results comparable to the state of the art on similar tasks in diachrony. However, we show that encouraging evaluation results do not translate to practical value in detecting new semantic shifts. Finally, our application of token-level embeddings accelerates manual data exploration and provides an efficient way of scaling up sociolinguistic analyses.",
