Introduction The Clarity project is devoted to automatic detection and classification of discourse structures in casual, non-task-oriented conversation using shallow, corpus-based methods of analysis. The main application of the Clarity discourse classifiers will be automatic detection of what discourse participants are doing. This includes identifying genres (e.g., lecture vs. casual conversation) [1], functional activities (e.g., planning vs. gossiping), and discourse phases (e.g., opening vs. closing of a negotiation) among other things [3] . 1 l In the work that we are reporting here we do not, however, study the notion of genre or register as brought forth in functional systemic theory. We will say more about this below. The first stage of the Clarity project involved developing an architecture for a multi-level discourse classifier to be trained and tested on three discourse levels: speech acts, dialogue games, and functional activities. Tagging, training, and testing was carried out on the Call Home Spauish (CHS) corpus of casual, non-task oriented conversation between family members. The coding scheme for speech acts and games is described in [6, 9] . The automatic classification of speech acts and games is carried out in a multi-level architecture that integrates classification at multiple discourse levels instead of performing them sequentially. The multi-level classifier is described in [7] . The focus of this paper is on the cross-level classification of speech acts and dialogue games as it is carried out by the multi-level classifier. Results of a preliminary experiment show that the type or label of a game cannot be predicted from n-grams of the words it contains. Predicting game labels from the sequences of speech acts they contain yields slightly better results (better than baseline), but only when the speech acts are hand tagged, not when they are automatically detected. This is very preliminary research, and we plan in the future to experiment with linguistic features that are more predictive of game and functional activity labels. In the course of discussing our tagging scheme and classification results, we will comment on the specific adaptations of our coding scheme for nontask oriented dialogue and for its intended application to functional activity detection. The coding schemes for speech acts and dialogue games along with the adaptations for dialogue type and application are summarized in Sections 2 and 3. Section 4 describes the multilevel classification architecture and our experiments with cross-level classification of speech acts and games. Finally we will discuss the implications of our experiment for predicting higher levels of discourse structure from lower levels. Speech Act Tags Our speech act coding is based on the SWBD-DAMSL tag set from the Johns Hopkins LVCSR Summer Workshop 1997 [5] . Modifications were made in the tag set for four reasons. First, we made some changes to improve inter-coder agreement. After two taggers tagged CHS, we calculated intercoder agreement (79%). (See [6] for a description of how this was computed) and examined confusion matrices showing the tags that they disagreed on most. We eliminated the tag sv for statement of opinion because taggers did not distinguish reliably between sv and s, plain statement. To account for some aspects of opinions that we felt could be tagged, reliably, we have added features such as val +/-(positive or negative value judgement) to the category s. The second reason for changes to the coding scheme was breaking up large categories. Language models for large categories are thought to be mixed bags of diverse information that are not sufficiently distinct from language models of other categories. Smaller categories should yield more distinct language models. In our first pass tagging of CHS, statements (s} accounted for around 40 per cent of the tags. We broke up the s category by adding semantic feature tags (certainty, hypotheticality, expresses speakers mental state, positive/negative value judgement, obligation, past vs non-past tense, joke/sarcasm). In the revised coding scheme, unmarked s accounts for 26% per cent of the tags. Unfortunately, this subdivision of s did not work as we expected. When our automatic speech act classifier was trained on the subcategories of s, we found that the marked subcategories could be reliably distinguished from each other, but could not reliabiy be distinguished from unmarked s. We feel that this may be because the language model for unmarked s still characterizes too much diverse information which overlaps with the characteristics of the marked subcategories of s. The third reason for revisions of the coding scheme was to support the task of functional activity identification. We hypothesized that semantic features such as hypotheticality and uncertainty, might characterize planning-type activities in contrast to gossip-type activities. The correlation be-tween our semantic features and functional activities remains to be tested. The fourth reason for revising the coding scheme was to account for types of utterances that were very prominent in CHS, but not so prominent in SWBD. One tag that we added for this reason was atd (attention directive) for cue phrases such as oye (listen) and mira (look). Our speech act tags fall into the categories Questions, Answers, Agreement/Disagreement, Discourse Markers (including Backchannels), Forward Functions, Control Acts, Statements, and Other. The greatest changes with respect to SWBD-DAMSL involve an expansion of control acts, the addition of coarse emotional tags to backchannels, a collapse of statements and opinions, and the addition of semantic features to statements. The complete speech act tag set is listed in [6, 9] . The entire CHS corpus was re-tagged by one human tagger using this revised tag set. Intracoder agreement of over 90% was tested by having the tagger re-tag three dialogues several weeks after first tagging them. (Again, see [6] for how agreement was calculated.) Dialogue Game Tags for Non-Task-Oriented Dialogue We use the following characterization of dialogue games given by Carletta at al. [2]: \"a set of utterances starting with an initiation and encompassing all utterances up until the purpose of the game has been either fulfilled (e.g. the requested information has been transferred) or abandoned.\" However, our inventory of games differs from those used for the Map Task because we are dealing with non-task oriented dialogue. Our system contains eight main types of games plus eight modifiers. The game types are seeking informa'~ion, giving information, giving directive, action commit, giving opinion, expressive, seeking confirmation, and communication filler. The eight modifiers of game tags are sup (support previous statement), elab (elaborated answer to question), spec (speculation), wk (weak directive or commit), st (strong directive or commit), n (nested game), inc (incomplete game), aband (abandoned game). Taggers label turns within a game as Initiative, Response, and Feedback.   Games may overlap, either as nested games or as interleaved games. Game boundaries are determined by changes in who has the initiative and changes in speaker intention, for example changing from informing to questioning. The Multi-Level Classifier Architecture The detection of speech acts from words has received a substantial amount of attention in the recent past. Most of the recent literature (e.g. see [8, 4] and their references) describes classifiers that are based on n-gram modeling. This technology has proven to give reasonable results in a variety of domains, although some recent papers indicate shortcomings of this approach [10, 7] . The classifiers based on ngram modeling are a special instance of (higher-order) recursive hidden markov models. Recursive hidden markov models are used widely in speech recognition. We decided to built the incremental lattice construction framework [7] which allows us to account for the overlap problem (multiple speakers at the same time on different channels), the application of more complex classifiers (currently we are evaluating backoff-ngram models, neural networks and support vector machines) and the higher order structure. In this section we try to motivate the modeling of dialogue games by adding one more level to the speech act detection structure and show that this framework can be applied to the game detection task. Detection from the word level: It is not obvious from the outset how n-gram-based classifiers should be applied to the detection of discourse games. One could try to do segmentation and labeling of discourse gaines directly from the word level just as in the speech act task. This approach can be characterized as: G\" = argmaxcp(GlW ) = argmaxGp(W[G)p(G ) Assuming that we can model p(G) reasonably well by an n-gram model, the remaining task is to find a good estimate for p(WIG ). Assuming that the words in a game segment (given the game type) do not depend on other games or words this can be simplified to the more local rule: P(WIG)--1-X P(Wil Gi) i.=l,...,n Furthermore -to make the model tractable -we would like to model these probabilities with ngram models. However, it is highly questionable that p(WilGi ) can adequately be modeled using standard n-gram models, because: \u2022 it appears that a much smaller portion of ngrams have discriminative distributions for dialogue games in comparison with the speech act case \u2022 the interaction between the speakers is lost using word level bigram or trigram statistics Detection from the speech act level: For these reasons, we have been pursuing a second possible modeling approach, which estimates p(WilGi) with a probability model that uses speech-acts as an intermediate discourse level: p(W lG,) = p(W, lS,, G,)p(S, IG,) s Using similar independence assumptions as above we can rewrite this as p(w, IG,) = p(S, IG,) S j=l,...,rni In this setup potential speech act constraints of dialogue games are enforced explicitly. The distributions of p(Wi,j ISi,j, Gi) are also likely to be sharper since they are shorter and do not mix unrelated grammatical information. To make this model more tractable we can use a Viterbi approximation (which finds and uses the most likely speech act sequence rather than summing over all possible such sequences). Another simplification is to assume that the word probabilities are not dependent on the dialogue game they occur in, as long as the speech act is known: p(Wi,j IS/j, Gi) = p(Wi,j IS/j) This assumption can in fact be partially removed for frequent speech acts (for example, one could have separate statement types for different dialogue games). The overall estimate for p(Wi]Gi) would therefore be: argmaxs 1-~ p(SilGi) 1~ P(Wi,jlSl,j) i=l,...,n j=l,...,mi Incremental Lattice Construction: Both models (almost) fulfill the form of a recursive HMM, and a dynamic programming solution is known for finding the Viterbi speech-act path, However the algorithm is complex, especially if higher order models are used. Additionally, this model ignores the problem of modeling the overlap between speakers, which, when attacked, further complicates the algorithm. It would also be nice to be able to use more complex models for dialogue game detection, especially models that would allow us to transcend the usual n-gram constraints and that could be trained discriminatively 2. Given these complications, we had previously proposed an incremental lattice construction approach [7] (see Fig. 2 ), that does the following: 1. generate a lattice from the words 2. generate a lattice of all likely segments from the lattice of the previous level 2The models mentioned above can easily be trained with the maximum likelihood criterion. Howeversince we have many irrelevant n-grams -it might be advantageous to train these models just to attain a good discrimination performance, see [7, 113] . 3. label all segments in the new lattice wi~h their tag and likelihood 4. goto step 2 (next discourse level) or continue to step 5 5. search the most likely path in the complete lattice given a language model and the likelihoods in the lattice The input to the discourse classifier can be a lattice of words, e.g. produced by a speech recognizer. A lattice of segments is produced by an A* search over the input lattice that can hypothesize segment boundaries and inserts every segment hypothesis into the segment lattice. The speech act lattice is generated by replacing each segment by the set of all possible speech act labels and assigning a likelihood for each segment given the speech act. This lattice can then be segmented again and annotated with dialogue games. A Viterbi search can then find the best combined speech act and g~me sequence. Experiments We have conducted experiments for dialogue game detection where we assumed that the boundaries of the games were known 3 We used the seven primary game tags info, quest, seek_conf, opinion, direct, express and UNDEFINED. Since the primary tag info was frequently combined with the orthogonal tag elab we split the info category along that secondary tag. We used 22 dialogues for training and testing, applying a 7-fold cross-validation. No intercoder agreement tests have been conducted so far (Table 1 Speech act segmentation and labeling Figure 2 : Incremental lattice construction (reproduced from [7] ) conclusions. First, game tags cannot be predicted from n-grams of words --at least not taking all words into account equally. This does not eliminate the possibility that there may be discriminative n-grams of words hidden in various positions in the game, and this is a research direction that we would like to explore. Our second observation is that speech acts help a little in predicting game labels, although current speech act classification technology does not yield good enough results for this purpose. The reason that speech acts help as an intermediate level between words and games may be because the speech acts already encode some of the discriminating words that are necessary for game detection. Finally, we are left with the observation that we have not yet identified the linguistic cues that are relevant to game classification. Our future plans include experimenting with a variety of linguistic cues of the sort discussed by [3, 1] in the hope of finding some predictive features that are not captured by our current speech act tag set. Another line of research is to question the relevance of the discourse units we are using --dialogue games in particular --to the tasks of identifying functional activities, genres, or phases of a discourse. On the one hand, dialogue games provide potentially important information about which utterances are initiatives and which are re-sponses, thus helping to identify which speakers are dominant at different points in the conversation. On the other hand, dialogue games may not identify initiative in the most useful way. If the first speaker is providing a recount of all event the second speaker may often ask a question with the sole purpose of displaying his/her attention to the story being told. Our current tagging scheme would identify such a question as an initiating utterance of a question/answer game that is initiated by the second speaker with the first speaker in a responding role. Clearly this does not reflect the actual discourse situation in this case: The first speaker is in charge and the second speaker merely displays attention. For reasons such as this, we have begun to investigate different types of discourse units based on the idea of genres from system functional linguistics. However, in contrast to the traditional work on genre (see [3] for a review) we have found that in our corpus, distinctions that are based on fixed patterns are hard to describe and we are therefore actively working on a new annotation scheme for something similar to genres. Our proposal is to identify genre units which consist of utterances having genre-specific functions. A genre unit might, for example, be a piece of a conversation that contains gossip. Utterances in this gossip unit might have gossip-specific functions such as introducing a topic of gossip, summarizing the story (which would consist of non-evaluative statements in the middle of the gossip unit), giving the main value judgement, etc. Another genre unit might be a story and one of the genre specific functions of a question might be to encourage the story teller. Our multi-level classification architecture will help us explore alternative tagging schemes for multiple levels of discourse structure and the interaction between them. Other Applications of the Multi-level Classifier We are currently also using the multi-level classifter architecture described above for the task of detecting dialogue acts in the context of a spoken language translation system for the travel domain [11] . In this system, dialogue acts, parameterized with arguments and their values, serve as a shallow interlingua representation for translating spoken utterances into other target languages. To detect dialogue acts, we use a two-level model of discourse structure where the lowest level of structure consists of semantic argument categories (such as time and date expressions, location expressions, and other descriptions of travel domain entities). These semantic argument categories are detected from the utterance using word n-gram models. Speech acts serve as the second level of discourse structure in this system, and are modeled via n-grams of semantic argument categories. The combination of speech act and semantic argument categories are then mapped into a complete dialogue act. Statistical dialogue act detection is intended to serve as robust alternative to a more traditional grammar based analysis component. This indicates that the multi-level classifier architecture described here is useful for a variety of applications involving classification of complex language and discourse structures. [1] [2]",
