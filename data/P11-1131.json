    "article": "We propose a principled and efficient phraseto-phrase alignment model, useful in machine translation as well as other related natural language processing problems. In a hidden semi-Markov model, word-to-phrase and phraseto-word translations are modeled directly by the system. Agreement between two directional models encourages the selection of parsimonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the overfitting commonly encountered in unsupervised training with multi-word units. Expanding the state space to include \"gappy phrases\" (such as French ne pas) makes the alignment space more symmetric; thus, it allows agreement between discontinuous alignments. The resulting system shows substantial improvements in both alignment quality and translation quality over word-based Hidden Markov Models, while maintaining asymptotically equivalent runtime. Introduction Word alignment is an important part of statistical machine translation (MT) pipelines. Phrase tables containing pairs of source and target language phrases are extracted from word alignments, forming the core of phrase-based statistical machine translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003) . Most syntactic machine translation systems extract synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) from aligned syntactic fragments (Galley et al., 2004; Zollmann et al., 2006) , which in turn are derived from bilingual word alignments and syntactic parses. Alignment is also used in various other NLP problems such as entailment, paraphrasing, question answering, summarization and spelling correction. A limitation to word-based alignment is undesirable. As seen in the French-English example in Figure 1 , many sentence pairs are naturally aligned with multi-word units in both languages (chemin de fer; would like, where indicates a gap). Much work has addressed this problem: generative models for direct phrasal alignment (Marcu and Wong, 2002 ), heuristic word-alignment combinations (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2003) , models with pseudoword collocations (Lambert and Banchs, 2006; Ma et al., 2007; Duan et al., 2010) , synchronous grammar based approaches (Wu, 1997) , etc. Most have a large state-space, using constraints and approximations for efficient inference. We present a new phrasal alignment model based on the hidden Markov framework (Vogel et al., 1996) . Our approach is semi-Markov: each state can generate multiple observations, representing wordto-phrase alignments. We also augment the state space to include contiguous sequences. This corresponds to phrase-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments. We generalize alignment by agreement (Liang et al., 2006) to this space, and find that agreement discourages EM from overfitting. Finally, we make the alignment space more symmetric by including gappy (or non-contiguous) phrases. This allows agreement to reinforce non-contiguous align- ments, such English not to French ne pas. Pruning the set of allowed phrases preserves the time complexity of the word-to-word HMM alignment model. Related Work Our first major influence is that of conditional phrase-based models. An early approach by Deng and Byrne (2005) changed the parameterization of the traditional word-based HMM model, modeling subsequent words from the same state using a bigram model. However, this model changes only the parameterization and not the set of possible alignments. More closely related are the approaches of Daum\u00e9 III and Marcu (2004) and DeNero et al. (2006) , which allow phrase-to-phrase alignments between the source and target domain. As DeNero warns, though, an unconstrained model may overfit using unusual segmentations. Interestingly, the phrase-based hidden semi-Markov model of Andr\u00e9s-Ferrer and Juan (2009) does not seem to encounter these problems. We suspect two main causes: first, the model interpolates with Model 1 (Brown et al., 1994) , which may help prevent overfitting, and second, the model is monotonic, which screens out many possible alignments. Monotonicity is generally undesirable, though: almost all parallel sentences exhibit some reordering phenomena, even when languages are syntactically very similar. The second major inspiration is alignment by agreement by Liang et al. (2006) . Here, soft intersection between the forward (F\u2192E) and backward (E\u2192F) alignments during parameter estimation produces better word-to-word correspondences. This unsupervised approach produced alignments with incredibly low error rates on French-English, though only moderate gains in end-to-end machine translation results. Likely this is because the symmetric portion of the HMM space contains only single word to single word links. As shown in Figure 2 , in order to retain the phrasal link f 1 \u223c e 1 , e 2 after agreement, we need the reverse phrasal link e 1 , e 2 f 1 in the backward direction. However, this is not possible in a word-based HMM where each observation must be generated by a single state. Agreement tends to encourage 1-to-1 alignments with very high precision and but lower recall. As each word alignment acts as a constraint on phrase extraction, the phrase-pairs obtained from those alignments have high recall and low precision. Gappy Phrasal Alignment Our goal is to unify phrasal alignment and alignment by agreement. We use a phrasal hidden semi-Markov alignment model, but without the monotonicity requirement of Andr\u00e9s-Ferrer and Juan (2009) . Since phrases may be used in both the state and observation space of both sentences, agreement during EM training no longer penalizes phrasal links such as those in Figure 2 . Moreover, the benefits of agreement are preserved: meaningful phrasal links that are likely in both directions of alignment will be reinforced, while phrasal links likely in only one direction will be discouraged. This avoids segmentation problems encountered by DeNero et al. (2006) . Non-contiguous sequences of words present an additional challenge. Even a semi-Markov model with phrases can represent the alignment between English not and French ne pas in one direction only. To make the model more symmetric, we extend the state space to include gappy phrases as well. 1 The set of alignments in each model becomes symmetric, though the two directions model gappy phrases differently. Consider not and ne pas: when predicting French given English, the alignment corresponds to generating multiple distinct ob- servations from the same state; in the other direction, the word not is generated by a single gappy phrase ne pas. Computing posteriors for agreement is somewhat complicated, so we resort to an approximation described later. Exact inference retains a low-order polynomial runtime; we use pruning to increase speed. Hidden Markov Alignment Models Our model can be seen as an extension of the standard word-based Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used in alignment (Vogel et al., 1996) . To ground the discussion, we first review the structure of that model. This generative model has the form p(O|S) = A p(A, O|S), where S = (s 1 , . . . , s I ) \u2208 \u03a3 is a sequence of words from a vocabulary \u03a3; O = (o 1 , . . . , o J ) \u2208 \u03a0 is a sequence from vocabulary \u03a0; and A = (a 1 , . . . , a J ) is the alignment between the two sequences. Since some words are systematically inserted during translation, the target (state) word sequence is augmented with a special NULL word. To retain the position of the last aligned word, the state space contains I copies of the NULL word, one for each position (Och and Ney, 2003) . The alignment uses positive positions for words and negative positions for NULL states, so a j \u2208 {1..I} \u222a {\u22121.. \u2212 I}, and s i = NULL if i < 0. It uses the following generative procedure. First the length of the observation sequence is selected based on p l (J|I). Then for each observation position, the state is selected based on the prior state: a null state with probability p 0 , or a non-null state at position a j with probability (1 \u2212 p 0 ) \u2022 p j (a j |a j\u22121 ) where p j is a jump distribution. Finally the observation word o j at that position is generated with probability p t (o j |s a j ), where p t is an emission distribution: p(A, O|S) = p l (J|I) J j=1 p j (a j |a j\u22121 )p t (o j |s a j ) p j (a|a ) = (1 \u2212 p 0 ) \u2022 p d (a \u2212 |a |) a > 0 p 0 \u2022 \u03b4(|a|, |a |) a < 0 We pick p 0 using grid search on the development set, p l is uniform, and the p j and p t are optimized by EM. 2 Gappy Semi-Markov Models The HMM alignment model identifies a wordto-word correspondence between the observation words and the state words. We make two changes to expand this model. First, we allow contiguous phrases on the observation side, which makes the model semi-Markov: at each time stamp, the model may emit more than one observation word. Next, we also allow contiguous and gappy phrases on the state side, leading to an alignment model that can retain phrasal links after agreement (see Section 4). The S and O random variables are unchanged. Since a single state may generate multiple observation words, we add a new variable K representing the number of states. K should be less than J, the number of observations. The alignment variable is augmented to allow contiguous and non-contiguous ranges of words. We allow only a single gap, but of unlimited length. The null state is still present, and is again represented by negative numbers. A =(a 1 , . . . , a K ) \u2208 A(I) A(I) ={(i 1 , i 2 , g)|0 < i 1 \u2264 i 2 \u2264 I, g \u2208 {GAP, CONTIG}}\u222a {(\u2212i, \u2212i, CONTIG) | 0 < i \u2264 I} We add one more random variable to capture the total number of observations generated by each state. L \u2208 {(l 0 , l 1 , . . . , l K ) | 0 = l 0 < \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 < l K = J} The generative model takes the following form: p(A, L, O|S) =p l (J|I)p f (K|J) K k=1 p j (a k |a k\u22121 )\u2022 p t (l k , o l k l k\u22121 +1 |S[a k ], l k\u22121 ) First, the length of the observation sequence (J) is selected, based on the number of words in the state-side sentence (I). Since it does not affect the alignment, p l is modeled as a uniform distribution. Next, we pick the total number of states to use (K), which must be less than the number of observations (J). Short state sequences receive an exponential penalty: p f (K|J) \u221d \u03b7 (J\u2212K) if 0 \u2264 K \u2264 J, or 0 otherwise. A harsh penalty (small positive value of \u03b7) may prevent the systematic overuse of phrases. 3 Next we decide the assignment of each state. We retain the first-order Markov assumption: the selection of each state is conditioned only on the prior state. The transition distribution is identical to the word-based HMM for single word states. For phrasal and gappy states, we jump into the first word of that state, and out of the last word of that state, and then pay a cost according to how many words are covered within that state. If a = (i 1 , i 2 , g), then the beginning word of a is F (a) = i 1 , the ending word is L(a) = i 2 , and the length N (a) is 2 for gapped states, 0 for null states, and last(a) \u2212 f irst(a) + 1 for all others. The transition probability is: p j (a|a ) = \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 p 0 \u2022 \u03b4(|F (a)|, |L(a )|) if F (a) < 0 (1 \u2212 p 0 )p d (F (a) \u2212 |L(a )|)\u2022 p n (N (a)) otherwise where p n (c) \u221d \u03ba c is an exponential distribution. As in the word HMM case, we use a mixture parameter p 0 to determine the likelihood of landing in a NULL state. The position of that NULL state remembers the last position of the prior state. For non-null words, we pick the first word of the state according to the distance from the last word of the prior state. Finally, we pick a length for that final state according to an exponential distribution: values of \u03ba less than one will penalize the use of phrasal states. For each set of state words, we maintain an emission distribution over observation word sequences. Let S[a] be the set of state words referred to by the alignment variable a. For example, the English given French alignment of Figure 3 includes the following state word sets: S[(2, 2, CONTIG)] = voudrais S[(1, 3, GAP)] = ne pas S[(6, 8, CONTIG)] = chemin de fer For the emission distribution we keep a multinomial over observation phrases for each set of state words: p(l, o l l |S[a], l ) \u221d c(o l l |S[a]) In contrast to the approach of Deng and Byrne (2005) , this encourages greater consistency across instances, and more closely resembles the commonly used phrasal translation models. We note in passing that p f (K|J) may be moved inside the product: 1) . The following form derived using the above rearrangement is helpful during EM. p f (K|J) \u221d \u03b7 (J\u2212K) = K k=1 \u03b7 (l k \u2212l k\u22121 \u2212 p(A, L, O|S) \u221d K k=1 p j (a k |a k\u22121 )\u2022 p t (l k , o l k l k\u22121 +1 |S[a k ], l k\u22121 )\u2022 \u03b7 (l k \u2212l k\u22121 \u22121) where l k \u2212 l k\u22121 \u2212 1 is the length of the observation phrase emitted by state S[a k ]. Minimality At alignment time we focus on finding the minimal phrase pairs, under the assumption that composed phrase pairs can be extracted in terms of these minimal pairs. We are rather strict about this, allowing only 1 \u2192 k and k \u2192 1 phrasal alignment edges (or links). This should not cause undue stress, since edges of the form 2 \u2212 3 (say e 1 e 2 \u223c f 1 f 2 f 3 ) can generally be decomposed into 1 \u2212 1 \u222a 1 \u2212 2 (i.e., e 1 \u223c f 1 \u222a e 2 \u223c f 2 f 3 ), etc. However, the model does not require this to be true: we will describe reestimation for unconstrained general models, but use the limited form for word alignment. Parameter Estimation We use Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate parameters. The forward-backward algorithm efficiently computes posteriors of transitions and emissions in the word-based HMM. In a standard HMM, emission always advances the observation position by one, and the next transition is unaffected by the emission. Neither of these assumptions hold in our model: multiple observations may be emitted at a time, and a state may cover multiple stateside words, which affects the outgoing transition. A modified dynamic program computes posteriors for this generalized model. The following formulation of the forwardbackward algorithm for word-to-word alignment is a good starting point. \u03b1[x, 0, y] indicates the total mass of paths that have just transitioned into state y at observation x but have not yet emitted; \u03b1[x, 1, y] represents the mass after emission but before subsequent transition. \u03b2 is defined similarly. (We omit NULL states for brevity; the extension is straightforward.) \u03b1[0, 0, y] = p j (y|INIT) \u03b1[x, 1, y] = \u03b1[x, 0, y] \u2022 p t (o x |s y ) \u03b1[x, 0, y] = y \u03b1[x \u2212 1, 1, y ] \u2022 p j (y|y ) \u03b2[n, 1, y] = 1 \u03b2[x, 0, y] = p t (o x |s y ) \u2022 \u03b2[x, 1, y] \u03b2[x, 1, y] = y p j (y |y) \u2022 \u03b2[x + 1, 0, y ] Not only is it easy to compute posteriors of both emissions (\u03b1[x, 0, y]p t (o x |s y )\u03b2[x, 1, y]) and transitions (\u03b1[x, 1, y]p j (y |y)\u03b2[x + 1, 0, y ]) with this formulation, it also simplifies the generalization to complex emissions. We update the emission forward probabilities to include a search over the possible starting points in the state and observation space: \u03b1[0, 0, y] =p j (y|INIT) \u03b1[x, 1, y] = x <x,y \u2264y \u03b1[x , 0, y ] \u2022 EMIT(x : x, y : y) \u03b1[x, 0, y] = y \u03b1[x \u2212 1, 1, y ] \u2022 p j (y|y ) \u03b2[n, 1, y] =1 \u03b2[x , 0, y ] = x <x,y \u2264y EMIT(x : x, y : y) \u2022 \u03b2[x, 1, y] \u03b2[x, 1, y] = y p j (y |y) \u2022 \u03b2[x + 1, 0, y ] Phrasal and gapped emissions are pooled into EMIT: EMIT(w : x, y : z) =p t (o x w |s z y ) \u2022 \u03b7 z\u2212y+1 \u2022 \u03ba x\u2212w+1 + p t (o x w |s y s z ) \u2022 \u03b7 2 \u2022 \u03ba x\u2212w+1 The transition posterior is the same as above. The emission is very similar: the posterior probability that o x w is aligned to s z y is proportional to \u03b1[w, 0, y] \u2022 p t (o x w |s z y )\u2022\u03b7 z\u2212y+1 \u2022\u03ba x\u2212w+1 \u2022\u03b2[x, 1, z]. For a gapped phrase, the posterior is proportional to \u03b1[w, 0, y] \u2022 p t (o x w |s y s z ) \u2022 \u03b7 2 \u2022 \u03ba x\u2212w+1 \u2022 \u03b2[x, 1, z]. Given an inference procedure for computing posteriors, unsupervised training with EM follows immediately. We use a simple maximum-likelihood update of the parameters using expected counts based on the posterior distribution. Alignment by Agreement Following Liang et al. (2006) , we quantify agreement between two models as the probability that the alignments produced by the two models agree on the alignment z of a sentence pair x = (S, O): z p 1 (z|x; \u03b8 1 )p 2 (z|x; \u03b8 2 ) To couple the two models, the (log) probability of agreement is added to the standard log-likelihood objective: max \u03b8 1 ,\u03b8 2 x log p 1 (x; \u03b8 1 ) + log p 2 (x; \u03b8 2 )+ log z p 1 (z|x; \u03b8 1 )p 2 (z|x; \u03b8 2 ) We use the heuristic estimator from Liang et al. (2006) , letting q be a product of marginals: E : q(z; x) := z\u2208z p 1 (z|x; \u03b8 1 )p 2 (z|x; \u03b8 2 ) where each p k (z|x; \u03b8 k ) is the posterior marginal of some edge z according to each model. Such a heuristic E step computes the marginals for each model separately, then multiplies the marginals corresponding to the same edge. This product of marginals acts as the approximation to the posterior used in the M step for each model. The intuition is that if the two models disagree on a certain edge z, then the marginal product is small, hence that edge is dis-preferred in each model. Contiguous phrase agreement. It is simple to extend agreement to alignments in the absence of gaps. Multi-word (phrasal) links are assigned some posterior probability in both models, as shown in the example in Figure 3 , and we multiply the posteriors of these phrasal links just as in the single word case. 4 \u03b3 F \u2192E (f i , e j ) := \u03b3 E\u2192F (e j , f i ) := [\u03b3 F \u2192E (f i , e j ) \u00d7 \u03b3 E\u2192F (e j , f i )] 4 Phrasal correspondences can be represented in multiple ways: multiple adjacent words could be generated from the same state either using one semi-Markov emission, or using multiple single word emissions followed by self-jumps. Only the first case is reinforced through agreement, so the latter is implicitly discouraged. We explored an option to forbid samestate transitions, but found it made little difference in practice. Gappy phrase agreement. When we introduce gappy phrasal states, agreement becomes more challenging. In the forward direction F\u2192E, if we have a gappy state aligned to an observation, say f i f j \u223c e k , then its corresponding edge in the backward direction E\u2192F would be e k f i f j . However, this is represented by two distinct and unrelated emissions. Although it is possible the compute the posterior probability of two non-adjacent emissions, this requires running a separate dynamic program for each such combination to sum the mass between these emissions. For the sake of efficiency we resort to an approximate computation of posterior marginals using the two word-to-word edges e k f i and e k f j . The forward posterior \u03b3 F \u2192E for edge f i f j \u223c e k is multiplied with the min of the backward posteriors of the edges e k f i and e k f j . \u03b3 F \u2192E (f i f j , e k ) := \u03b3 F \u2192E (f i f j , e k )\u00d7 min \u03b3 E\u2192F (e k , f i ), \u03b3 E\u2192F (e k , f j ) Note that this min is an upper bound on the desired posterior of edge e k f i f j , since every path that passes through e k f i and e k f j must pass through e k f i , therefore the posterior of e k f i f j is less than that of e k f i , and likewise less than that of e k f j . The backward posteriors of the edges e k f i and e k f j are also mixed with the forward posteriors of the edges to which they correspond. \u03b3 E\u2192F (e k , f i ) := \u03b3 E\u2192F (e k , f i ) \u00d7 \u03b3 F \u2192E (f i , e k )+ h<i<j \u03b3 F \u2192E (f h f i , e k ) + \u03b3 F \u2192E (f i f j , e k ) Pruned Lists of 'Allowed' Phrases To identify contiguous and gapped phrases that are more likely to lead to good alignments, we use wordto-word HMM alignments from the full training data in both directions (F\u2192E and E\u2192F). We collect observation phrases of length 2 to K aligned to a single state, i.e. o j i \u223c s, to add to a list of allowed phrases. For gappy phrases, we find all non-consecutive observation pairs o i and o j such that: (a) both are aligned to the same state s k , (b) state s k is aligned to only these two observations, and (c) at least one observation between o i and o j is aligned to a non-null state other than s k . These observation phrases are collected from F\u2192E and E\u2192F models to build contiguous and gappy phrase lists for both languages. Next, we order the phrases in each contiguous list using the discounted probability: p \u03b4 (o j i \u223c s|o j i ) = max(0, count(o j i \u223c s) \u2212 \u03b4) count(o j i ) where count(o j i \u223c s) is the count of occurrence of the observation-phrase o j i , all aligned to some single state s, and count(o j i ) is the count of occurrence of the observation phrase o j i , not all necessarily aligned to a single state. Similarly, we rank the gappy phrases using the discounted probability: p \u03b4 (o i o j \u223c s|o i o j ) = max(0, count(o i o j \u223c s) \u2212 \u03b4) count(o i o j ) where count(o i o j \u223c s) is the count of occurrence of the observations o i and o j aligned to a single state s with the conditions mentioned above, and count(o i o j ) is the count of general occurrence of the observations o i and o j in order. We find that 200 gappy phrases and 1000 contiguous phrases works well, based on tuning with a development set. Complexity Analysis Let m be the length of the state sentence S and n be the length of the observation sentence O. In IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1994) , with only a translation model, we can infer posteriors or max alignments in O(mn). HMM-based word-to-word alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996) adds a distortion model, increasing the complexity to O(m 2 n). Introducing phrases (contiguous) on the observation side, we get a HSMM (Hidden Semi-Markov Model). If we allow phrases of length no greater than K, then the number of observation types rises from n to Kn for an overall complexity of O(m 2 Kn). Introducing state phrases (contiguous) with length \u2264 K grows the number of state types from m to Km. Complexity further increases to O((Km) 2 Kn) = O(K 3 m 2 n). Finally, when we introduce gappy state phrases of the type s i s j , the number of such phrases is O(m 2 ), since we may choose a start and end point independently. Thus, the total complexity rises to O((Km + m 2 ) 2 Kn) = O(Km 4 n). Although this is less than the O(n 6 ) complexity of exact ITG (Inversion Transduction Grammar) model (Wu, 1997) , a quintic algorithm is often quite slow. The pruned lists of allowed phrases limit this complexity. The model is allowed to use observation (contiguous) and state (contiguous and gappy) phrases only from these lists. The number of phrases that match any given sentence pair from these pruned lists is very small (\u223c 2 to 5). If the number of phrases in the lists that match the observation and state side of a given sentence pair are small constants, the complexity remains O(m 2 n), equal to that of word-based models. Results We evaluate our models based on both word alignment and end-to-end translation with two language pairs: English-French and English-German. For French-English, we use the Hansards NAACL 2003 shared-task dataset, which contains nearly 1.1 million training sentence pairs. We also evaluated on German-English Europarl data from WMT2010, with nearly 1.6 million training sentence pairs. The model from Liang et al. (2006) is our word-based baseline. Training Regimen Our training regimen begins with both the forward (F\u2192E) and backward (E\u2192F) iterations of Model 1 run independently (i.e. without agreement). Next, we train several iterations of the forward and backward word-to-word HMMs, again with independent training. We do not use agreement during word alignment since it tends to produce sparse 1-1 alignments, which in turn leads to low phrase emission probabilities in the gappy model. Initializing the emission probabilities of the semi-Markov model is somewhat complicated, since the word-based models do not assign any mass to the phrasal or gapped configurations. Therefore we use a heuristic method. We first retrieve the Viterbi alignments of the forward and backward word-to-word HMM aligners. For phrasal correspondences, we combine these forward and backward Viterbi alignments using a common heuristic (Union, Intersection, Refined, or Grow-Diag-Final), and extract tight phrase-pairs (no unaligned words on the boundary) from this alignment set. We found that Grow-Diag-Final was most effective in our experiments. The counts gathered from this phrase extraction are used to initialize phrasal translation probabilities. For gappy states in a forward (F\u2192E) model, we use alignments from the backward (E\u2192F) model. If a state s k is aligned to two non-consecutive observations o i and o j such that s k is not aligned to any other observation, and at least one observation between o i and o j is aligned to a non-null state other than s k , then we reverse this link to get o i o j \u223c s k and use it as a gappedstate-phrase instance for adding fractional counts. Given these approximate fractional counts, we perform a standard MLE M-step to initialize the emission probability distributions. The distortion probabilities from the word-based model are used without changes. Alignment Results (F1) The validation and test sentences have been handaligned (see Och and Ney (2003) ) and are marked with both sure and possible alignments. For French-English, following Liang et al. (2006) , we lowercase all words, and use the validation set plus the first 100 test sentences as our development set and the remaining 347 test-sentences as our test-set for final F1 evaluation. 5 In German-English, we have a development set of 102 sentences, and a test set of 258 sentences, also annotated with a set of sure and possible alignments. Given a predicted alignment A, precision and recall are computed using sure alignments S and possible alignments P (where S \u2286 P ) as in Och and Ney (2003) : P recision = |A \u2229 P | |A| \u00d7 100% Recall = |A \u2229 S| |S| \u00d7 100% 5 We report F1 rather than AER because AER appears not to correlate well with translation quality.

AER = 1 \u2212 |A \u2229 S| + |A \u2229 P | |A| + |S| \u00d7 100% F 1 = 2 \u00d7 P recision \u00d7 Recall P recision + Recall \u00d7 100% Many free parameters were tuned to optimize alignment F1 on the development set, including the number of iterations of each Model 1, HMM, and Gappy; the NULL weight p 0 , the number of contiguous and gappy phrases to include, and the maximum phrase length. Five iterations of all models, p 0 = 0.3, using the top 1000 contiguous phrases and the top 200 gappy phrases, maximum phrase length of 5, and penalties \u03b7 = \u03ba = 1 produced competitive results. Note that by setting \u03b7 and \u03ba to one, we have effectively removed the penalty altogether without affecting our results. In Table 1 we see a consistent improvement with the addition of contiguous phrases, and some additional gains with gappy phrases. Translation Results (BLEU) We assembled a phrase-based system from the alignments (using only contiguous phrases consistent with the potentially gappy alignment), with 4 channel models, word and phrase count features, distortion penalty, lexicalized reordering model, and a 5-gram language model, weighted by MERT. The same free parameters from above were tuned to optimize development set BLEU using grid search. The improvements in Table 2 are encouraging, especially as a syntax-based or non-contiguous phrasal system (Galley and Manning, 2010) may benefit more from gappy phrases. Conclusions and Future Work We have described an algorithm for efficient unsupervised alignment of phrases. Relatively straightforward extensions to the base HMM allow for efficient inference, and agreement between the two models prevents EM from overfitting, even in the absence of harsh penalties. We also allow gappy (noncontiguous) phrases on the state side, which makes agreement more successful but agreement needs approximation of posterior marginals. Using pruned lists of good phrases, we maintain complexity equal to the baseline word-to-word model. There are several steps forward from this point. Limiting the gap length also prevents combinatorial explosion; we hope to explore this in future work. Clearly a translation system that uses discontinuous mappings at runtime (Chiang, 2007; Galley and Manning, 2010) may make better use of discontinuous alignments. This model can also be applied at the morpheme or character level, allowing joint inference of segmentation and alignment. Furthermore the state space could be expanded and enhanced to include more possibilities: states with multiple gaps might be useful for alignment in languages with template morphology, such as Arabic or Hebrew. More exploration in the model space could be useful -a better distortion model might place a stronger distribution on the likely starting and ending points of phrases.

    "abstract": "We propose a principled and efficient phraseto-phrase alignment model, useful in machine translation as well as other related natural language processing problems. In a hidden semi-Markov model, word-to-phrase and phraseto-word translations are modeled directly by the system. Agreement between two directional models encourages the selection of parsimonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the overfitting commonly encountered in unsupervised training with multi-word units. Expanding the state space to include \"gappy phrases\" (such as French ne pas) makes the alignment space more symmetric; thus, it allows agreement between discontinuous alignments. The resulting system shows substantial improvements in both alignment quality and translation quality over word-based Hidden Markov Models, while maintaining asymptotically equivalent runtime.",
