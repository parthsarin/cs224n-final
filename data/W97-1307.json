Introduction Anaphora resolution is a component technology of an overall discourse understanding system. This paper focuses on reference resolution in an information extraction system, which performs a partial and selective 'understanding' of unrestricted discourses. Reference Resolution in IE An information extraction (IE) system automatically extracts certain predefined target information from real-world online texts or speech transcripts. The target information, typically of the form \"who did what to whom where when,\" is extracted from natural language sentences or formatted tables, and fills parts of predefined template data structures with slot values. Partially filled template data objects about the same entities, entity relationships, and events are then merged to create a network of related data objects. These template data objects depicting instances of the target information are the raw output of IE, ready for a wide range of applications such as database 46 updating and summary generation. 1 In this IE context, reference resolution takes the form of merging partial data objects about the same entities, entity relationships, and events described at different discourse positions. Merging in IE is very difficult, accounting for a significant portion of IE errors in the final output. This paper focuses on the referential relationships among entities rather than the more complex problem of event merging. An IE system recognizes particular target information instances, ignoring anything deemed irrelevant. Reference resolution within IE, however, cannot operate only on those parts that describe target information because anaphoric expressions within target linguistic patterns may have antecedents outside of the target, and those that occur in an apparently irrelevant pattern may actually resolve to target entities. For this reason, reference resolution in the IE system needs access to all of the text rather than some selective parts. Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that a largely domain-independent method of reference resolution can be developed, which need not be tailored anew each time a new target is defined. In this paper, I discuss one such entity reference resolution algorithm for a general geo-political business domain developed for SRI's FASTUS TM system (Hobbs et al., 1996) , one of the leading IE systems, which can also be seen as a representative of today's IE technology. The Input to Reference Resolution Multiple top-scoring sites working on IE have converged on the use of finite-state linguistic patterns applied in stages of smaller to larger units. This finite-state transduction approach to IE, first introduced in SRI's FASTUS, has proven effective for real-world texts because full parsing is far too ambiguous, slow, and brittle against real-world sentences. This means that we cannot assume correct and full syntactic structures in the input to reference resolution in a typical IE system. The input is a set of (often overlapping or discontiguous) finite-state approximations of sentence parts. We must approximate fine-grained theoretical proposals about referential dependencies, and adapt them to the context of sparse and incomplete syntactic input. The input to reference resolution in the theoretical literature is assumed to be fully parsed sentences, often with syntactic attributes such as grammatical functions and thematic roles on the constituents (Webber, 1978; Sidner, 1979; Hobbs, 1978; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995) . In implemented reference resolution systems, for pronoun resolution in particular, there seems to be a trade-off between the completeness of syntactic input and the robustness with real-world sentences. In short, more robust and partial parsing gives us wider coverage, but less syntactic information also leads to less accuyate reference resolution. For instance, Lappin and Leass (1994) report an 86% accuracy for a resolution algorithm for third-person pronouns using fully parsed sentences as input. Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) then report a 75% accuracy for an algorithm that approximates Lappin and Leass's with more robust and coarse-grained syntactic input. After describing the algorithm in the next section, I will briefly compare the present approach with these pronoun resolution approaches. Algorithm This algorithm was first implemented for the MUC-6 FASTUS system (Appelt et al., 1995) , and produced one of the top scores (a recall of 59% and precision of 72%) in the MUC-6 Coreference Task, which evaluated systems' ability to recog-47 nize coreference among noun phrases (Sundheim, 1995) . Note that only identity of reference was evaluated there. 2 The three main factors in this algorithm are (a) accessible text regions, (b) semantic consistency, and (c) dynamic syntactic preference. The algorithm is invoked for each sentence after the earlier finite-state transduction phases have determined the best sequence(s) of nominal and verbal expressions. Crucially, each nominal expression is associated with a set of template data objects that record various linguistic and textual attributes of the referring expressions contained in it. These data objects are similar to discourse referents in discourse semantics (Karttunen, 1976; Kamp, 1981; Heim, 1982; Kamp and Reyle, 1993) , in that anaphoric expressions such as she are also associated with corresponding anaphoric entities. A pleonastic it has no associated entities. Quantificational nominals such as each company are associated with entity objects because they are 'anaphoric' to group entities accessible in the context. In this setup, the effect of reference resolution is merging of multiple entity objects. Here is the algorithm. 2Other referential relationships such as subset and partwhole did not reach sufficiently reliable interannotator agreements. Only identity of reference had a sufficiently high agreement rate (about 85%) between two human annotators. ZHigher text structure properties such as subsections and sections should also be considered if there are any. Exact accessibility computation using complex hierarchical text structures is a future topic of study. FOR EACH potentially anaphoric entity object in the current sentence, in the left-to-right order, DO (1) COLLECT antecedent entity objects from the accessible text region. \u2022 For an entity in a HEADLINE text region, the entire TEXT is accessible because the headline summarizes the text. \u2022 For an entity in a TEXT region, everything preceding its text span is accessible (except for the HEADLINE). Intrasentential cataphora is allowed only for first-person pronouns. \u2022 In addition, a locality assumption on anaphora sets a (soft) window of search for each referring expression type--the entire preceding text for proper names, narrower for definite noun phrases, even narrower for pronouns, and only the current sentence for reflexives. In the MUC-6 system, the window size was arbitrarily set to ten sentences for definites and three sentences for pronouns, ignoring paragraph boundariesl and no antecedents beyond the limit were considered. This clearly left ample room for refinement. 4 (2) FILTER with semantic consistency between the anaphoric entity E1 and the potential antecedent entity E2. \u2022 Number Consistency: El's number must be consistent with E2's number--for example, twelve is consistent with PLURAL, but not with SINGULAR. As a special case, plural pronouns (they, we) can take singular organization antecedents. \u2022 Sort Consistency: El's sort must either EQUAL or SUBSUME E2's sort. This reflects a monotonicity assumption on anaphora--for example, since company subsumes automaker, the company can take a Chicago-based automaker as an antecedent, but it is too risky to allow the automaker to take a Chicago-based company as an antecedent. On the other hand, since automaker and airline are neither the same sort nor in a subsumption relation, an automaker and the airline cannot corefer. (The system's sort hierarchy is still sparse and incomplete.) \u2022 Modifier Consistency: El's modifiers must be consistent with E2's modifiers--for example, French and British are inconsistent, but French and multinational are consistent. (The system doesn't have enough knowledge to do this well.) (3) ORDER by dynamic syntactic preference. The following ordering approximates the relative salience of entities. The basic underlying hypothesis is that intrasentential candidates are more salient than intersentential candidates as proposed, for example, in Hobbs (1978) and Kameyama (in press) , and that fine-grained syntax-based salience fades with time. Since fine-grained syntax with grammatical functions is unavailable, the syntactic prominence of subjects and left-dislocation is approximated by the left-right linear ordering. The MUC-6 system took the destructive option. The nondestructive option has been implemented in a more recent system. These basic steps of \"COLLECT, FILTER, and ORDER by salience\" are analogous to Lappin and Leass's (1994) pronoun resolution algorithm, but each step in FASTUS relies on considerably poorer syntactic input. The present algorithm thus provides an interesting case of what happens with extremely poor syntactic input, even poorer than in Kennedy and Boguraev's (1996) system. This comparison will be discussed later. Name Alias Recognition In addition to the above general algorithm, a special-purpose alias recognition algorithm is invoked for coreference resolution of proper names. 5 1. INPUT: The input English text is in mixed cases. An earlier transduction phase has recognized unknown names as well as specifictype names for persons, locations, or organizations using name-internal pattern matching and known name lists. 2. FOR EACH new sentence, FOR EACH unknown name, IF it is an alias or acronym of another name already recognized in the given text, MERGE the two--an alias is a selective substring of the full name (e.g., Colonial for Colonial Bee)~, and acronym is a selective sequence of initial characters in the full name (e.g., GM for General Motors). Overall Performance The MUC-6 FASTUS reference resolution algorithm handled only coreference (i.e., identity of reference) of proper names, definites, and pronouns. These are the 'core' anaphoric expression types whose dependencies tend to be constrained by surface textual factors such as locality. The MUC-6 Coreference Task evaluation included coreference of bare nominals, possessed nominals, and indefinites as well, which the system did not handle because we didn't have a reliable algorithm for these mostly 'accidental' coreferences that seemed to require deeper inferences. Nevertheless, the system scored a recall of 59% and precision of 72% in the blind evaluation of thirty newspaper articles. 1 shows the system's performance in resolving the core discourse anaphors in five randomely selected articles from the development set. Only five articles were examined here because the process was highly time-consuming. The performance for each expression type varies widely from article to article because of unexpected features of the articles. For instance, one of the five articles is a letter to the editor with a text structure drastically different from news reports. On average, we see that the resolution accuracy (i.e., recall) was the highest for proper names (69%), followed by pronouns (62%) and definites (46%). There were not enough instances of reflexives to compare. Table 2 shows the system's performance for pronouns broken down by two parameters, grammatical person and inter-vs. intrasentential antecedent. The system did quite well (78%) with third-person pronouns with intrasentential antecedents, the largest class of such pronouns. Part of the pronoun resolution performance here enables a preliminary comparison with the results reported in (1) Lappin and Leass (1994) and ( 2 ) Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) . For the thirdperson pronouns and reflexives, the performance was (1) 86% of 560 cases in five computer manuals and (2) 75% of 306 cases in twenty-seven Web page texts. The present FASTUS system correctly resolved 71% of 34 cases in five newspaper arti-cles. This progressive decline in performance corresponds to the progressive decline in the amount of syntactic information in the input to reference resolution. To summarize the latter decline, Lap-pin and Leass (1994) had the following components in their algorithm. With this input, grammatical functions and precedence relations were used to approximate 2 and 5. Finite-state patterns approximated 4. Three additional salience factors were used in 7, and a preference for intraclausal antecedents was added in 6; 3 and 8 were the same. The present algorithm works with an even poorer syntactic input, as summarized here. 1. INPUT: a set of finite-state approximations of sentence parts, which can be overlapping or discontiguous, with no grammatical function, subordination, or adjunct information. . 3. 4. . 50 No disjoint reference filter is used. Morphological filter is used. Pleonastic pronouns are recognized with finitestate patterns. Reflexives simply limit the search to the current sentence, with no attempt at recognizing coarguments. No reciprocals are treated. . Salience is approximated by computation based on linear order and recency. No grammatical parallelism is recognized. . Equivalence classes correspond to merged entity objects whose 'current' positions are always the most recent mentions. 8. Candidates are deterministically ordered, so no decision procedure is needed. Given how little syntactic information is used in FASTUS reference resolution, the 71% accuracy in pronoun resolution is perhaps unexpectedly high. This perhaps shows that linear ordering and recency are major indicators of salience, especially because grammatical functions correspond to constituent ordering in English. The lack of disjoint reference filter is not the most frequent source of errors, and a coarse-grained treatment of reflexives does not hurt very much, mainly because of the infrequency of reflexives. An Example Analysis In the IE context, the task of entity reference resolution is to recognize referential links among partially described entities within and across documents, which goes beyond third-person pronouns and identity of reference. The expression types to be handled include bare nominals, possessed nominals, and indefinites, whose referential links tend to be more 'accidental' than textually signaled, and the referential links to be recognized include subset, membership, and part-whole. Consider one of the five articles evaluated, the one with the most number and variety of referential links, for which FASTUS's performance was the poorest. Even for the 'core' anaphoric expressions of 20 definites, 14 pronouns, and 7 names limited  to coreference, for which the code was prepared, the recall was only 51%. Figure 1 shows this article annotated with referential indices. The same index indicates coreference. Index subscripts (such as 4a) indicate subset, part, or membership of another expression (e.g., indexed 4). The index number ordering, 1,...,N, has no significance. Each sentence in the TEXT region is numbered with paragraph and sentence numbers, so, for instance, 2-1 is the first sentence in the second paragraph. Note that not all of these referential links need be recognized for each particular IE application. However, since reference resolution must consider all of the text for any particular application for the reason mentioned above, it is reasonable to assume that an ideal domain-independent reference resolution component should be able to recognize all of these. Is this a realistic goal, especially in an IE context? This question is left open for now. Error Analysis Table 3 shows the system's performance in recognizing the referential links in this article, grouped by referring expression types. These exclude the initial mention of each referential chain. Notable sources of errors and necessary extensions are summarized for each expression type here. Pronouns: Of the four pronoun resolution errors, one is due to a parse error (American in 7-1 was incorrectly parsed as a person entity, to which she in 8-1 was resolved), that in 6-2 is a discourse deixis (Webber, 1988) , beyond the scope of the current approach, and two errors (it in 3-1 and its in 7-1) were due to the left-right ordering of intrasentential candidates. Recognition of par-51 allelism among clause conjuncts and a stricter locality preference for possessive pronouns may help here. Definites: Of the fifteen incorrect resolutions of definites, five have nonidentity referential relationships, and hence were not handled. These nonidentity cases must be handled to avoid erroneous identity-only resolutions. Two errors were due to the failure to distinguish between generic and specific events. Token-referring definites (the union in 8-2 and the company in 9-1) were incorrectly resolved to recently mentioned types. Three errors were due to the failure to recognize synonyms between, for example, call (3-2) vs. request (3-1) and campaign (9-1) vs. strategy (9-1). Other error sources are a failure in recognizing an appositive pattern (9-1), the left-right ordering of the candidates in the previous sentence (9-2), and three 'bugs'. Proper Names: Name alias recognition was unusually poor (2 out of 7) because American was parsed as a person-denoting noun. The lowercase print in Patt gibbs also made it difficult to link it with Ms. Gibbs. Such parse errors and input anomalies hurt performance. Bare Nominals: Since bare nominaJs were not explicitly resolved, the only correct resolutions (3 out of 12) were due to recognition of appositive patterns. How can the other cases be treated? We need to understand the discourse semantics of bare nominMs better before developing an effective algorithm. Possessed Nominals: A systematic treatment of possessed nominals is a necessary extension. The basic algorithm will look like this--resolve the possessor entity A of the possessed nominal ASs B, then if there is already an entity of type B associated with A mentioned anywhere in the preceding text, then this is the referent of B. Possessed nominal resolution also requires a 'synonymy' computation to resolve, for example, its battle (9-1) to its corporate campaign (7-1). It also needs 'inferences' that rely on multiple successful resolutions. For instance, her members in 8-1 must first resolve her to Ms. Gibbs, who is president of the association, and this 'association' is the Association of Professional Flight Attendants. After it is understood as 'the members of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants,' the coreference with the flight attendants can be inferred. Similarly for our women in 8-1. Indefinites: Some indefinites are 'coreferential' to generic types, for example, a corporate campaign (7-2, 8-1). Given the difficulty in distinguishing between generic and specific event descriptions, it is unclear whether it will ever be treated in a systematic way. Conclusions In an operational end-to-end discourse understanding system, a reference resolution component must work with input data containing parse errors, lexicon gaps, and mistakes made by earlier reference resolution. In a state-of-the-art IE system such as SRI's FASTUS, reference resolution must work with considerably impoverished syntactic analysis of the input sentences. The present reference resolution approach within an IE system is robust and efficient, and performs pronoun resolution to an almost comparable level with a high-accuracy algorithm in the literature. Desirable extensions include nonidentity referential relationships, treatments of bare nominals, possessed nominals, and indefinites, type-token distinctions, and recognition of synonyms. Another future direction is to turn this component into a corpus-based statistical approach using the relevant factors identified in the rule-based approach. The need for a large tagged corpus may be difficult to satisfy, however. Acknowledgment This work was in part supported by U.S. government contracts~ _---_\" __:3",
