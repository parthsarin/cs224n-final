    "article": "INTRODUCTIO N The Computing Research Laboratory (New Mexico State University) and the Computer Science Departmen t (Brandeis University) are collaborating on the development of a system (DIDEROT) to perform data extraction for the Tipster project . This system is still far from fully developed, but as many of the techniques bein g used are domain -and in many cases language-independent, we have assembled them in a preliminar y manner to produce a prototype system (MucBruce l ), which handles the MUC-4 texts . The overall system architecture is shown in Figure 1 . The development of the software and data used for MucBruce has been carried out over a three mont h period beginning at the end of February, 1992 . The present version of the system relies extensively on statistically-based measures of relevance made both at the text and the paragraph level . Texts are tagge d for a variety of features by a pipeline of processes . The marked texts and the paragraph relevancy informatio n are used to allow a scan around keywords for appropriate slot filling strings . The system has been augmented since the dry-run with a parser which processes sentences which contain a word with an associated Generativ e Lexical Semantic (GLS) definition . This component was added by Brandeis late in the development process and has access to approximately 20 lexical definitions . Our results reflect the extremely simplistic approach to identifying the slot fills in a text . We feel confident , however, that an expansion of the coverage of our GLS entries and the addition of further constraints to prevent template overgeneration will produce significant improvements . We have created a set of tagging and statistical techniques which will apply to any text type, given appropriate training data . SYSTEM FEATURE S The system consists of three front-end components all of which are C or Lex programs : \u2022 A text relevancy marke r \u2022 A paragraph relevancy marker \u2022 A text tagging pipeline and two MUC specific Prolog programs : \u2022 A template constructor \u2022 A template formatte r 'We seem to have adopted a philosophical stance for our system nomenclature, and this particular Australian philosophe r seemed to embody some of the ad hoc notions which, at the moment, glue our system together. Tagge r Input file : TST2-MUC4-0007, f 4-4. Start Overview} Quit )  One of our principal intentions is to automate as much as possible all the processes associated with th e creation of a text extraction system . Our statistical techniques for relevant text recognition use word list s which are automatically derived from training data . Our text tagger uses proper name information derive d from the key templates and other taggers for human names and dates are largely domain independent . We intend to derive the entire core lexicon for the system from Machine Readable Dictionaries and then to tun e it against appropriate corpora . OFFICIAL RESULT S Our results are shown in tables 1 and 2 . The results for test 4 are much poorer then those for test 3 . We have not established any specific causes for this difference . For most of the individual slots we see some improvement in recall and a greater improvement in precision over the results of the dry run test . Th e MucBruce system is not parameterized in any way to affect recall or precision . To change these we woul d require modifying the parameters given to the text statistics programs . For MUC-4 we tried to improve precision at the expense of some recall . It is extremely difficult to measure the accuracy of the templat e predicting programs, as their performance can be easily masked by errors occurring in the template producing sections of the system . We need to run separate tests of these components to establish the exact relationshi p on performance of the text statistics, text marking and template producing components . We have not yet , however, had time to carry out these tests on the new MUC-4 data . EFFORT SPEN T Approximately ten people have worked at one time or another on the MUC-4 system over the last thre e months . They were all, however, also working on other projects over this period . A rough estimate of the time involved would be six person-months . The major areas of work were in developing and refinin g the statistical techniques, designing and developing the tagging software and implementing a system whic h could use our current incomplete set of components . Work also went into designing and implementing an appropriate form for the Generative Lexical Semantic entries . Our limiting factor was definitely time . In the last month we generalized the lexical entries in ou r tagging file . This meant our system was often likely to recognize partial strings as being appropriate filler s (e .g . GUERILLAS) . We intended to avoid this problem by incorporating the BBN part of speech tagge r (POST) into our MUC-4 system and to write code to glue together noun phrases occurring around our ne w general tags . All this code was written and tested just before the MUC-4 final test, but we were unable t o incorporate it in time . The training texts were used to generate our statistical information and word lists . The methods use d are automatic and require only the setting of thresholds for word selection . The system has improved its performance slightly since the dry run test . Many of our changes in isolation are detrimental and require the addition of other techniques to establish their usefulness . CONCLUSION S The basic system is essentially domain-independent and around 80% of it should be directly usable in othe r applications . The module which needs the greatest amount of work is the template creator . Much of this will be replaced as we develop our system for Tipster . It would have been nice to see the effect of adding the part of speech tagger and the noun phrase recognizer to the system . The test deadlines and the availability of the MUC-3 corpus have proved extremely useful to our researc h efforts, both encouraging us to get a robust working system together and to look critically at its performance .",
