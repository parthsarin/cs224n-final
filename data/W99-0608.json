Additionally, the problem of data sparseness is also addressed by applying a technique of generating convez pseudo-data (Breiman, 1998) . Experimental results and a comparison to other state-of-theart tuggers are reported. Introduction The study of general methods to improve the performance in classification tasks, by the combination of different individual classifiers, is a currently very active area of research in supervised learning. In the machine learning (ML) literature this approach is known as ensemble, stacked, or combined classifiers. Given a classification problem, the main goal is to construct several independent classifiers, since it has been proven that when the errors committed by individual classifiers are uncorrelated to a sufficient degree, and their error rates are low enough, the resulting combined classifier performs better than all the individual systems (Ali and Pazzani, 1996; Tumer and Ghosh, 1996; Dietterich, 1997) . Several methods have been proposed in order to construct ensembles of classifiers that make uncorrelated errors. Some of them are general, and they can be applied to any learning algorithln, while other are specific to particular algorithms. From a different perspective, there exist methods for constructing homogeneous ensembles, in the sense that a unique learning algorithm has been used to acquire each individ-ual classifier, and heterogeneous ensembles that combine different types of learning paradigms 1. Impressive results have been obtained by applying these techniques on the so-called unstable learning algorithms (e.g. induction of decision trees, neural networks, rule-induction systems, etc.). Several applications to real tasks have been performed, and, regarding NLP, we find ensembles of classifiers in context-sensitive spelling correction (Golding and Roth, 1999 ), text categorization (Schapire and Singer, 1998; Blum and Mitchell, 1998) , and text filtering (Schapire et al., 1998) . Combination of classitiers have also been applied to POS tagging. For instance, van Halteren (1996) combined a number of similar tuggers by way of a straightforward majority vote. More recently, two parallel works (van Halteren et al., 1998; Brill and Wu, 1998) combined, with a remarkable success, the output of a set of four tuggers based on different principles and feature modelling. Finally, in the work by MSxquez et al. (1998) the combination of taggers is used in a bootstrapping algorithm to train a part of speech tagger from a limited amount of training material. The aim of the present work is to improve an existing POS tagger based on decision trees (Mkrquez and Rodriguez, 1997) , by using ensembles of classifiers. This tagger treats separately the different types (classes) of ambiguity by considering a different decision tree for each class. This fact allows a selective construction of ensembles of decision trees focusing on the most relevant ambiguity classes, which greatly vary in size and difficulty. Another goal of the present work is to try to alleviate the problem of data sparseness by applying a method, due 1An excellent survey covering all these topics call be found in (Dietterich, 1997) . to Breiman (1998) , for generating new pseudoexamples from existing data. As we will see in section 4.2 this technique will be combined with the construction of an ensemble of classifiers. The paper is organized as follows: we start by presenting the two versions of the POS tagger and their evaluation on the reference corpus (sections 2 and 3). Sections 4 and 5 are, respectively, devoted to present the machine-learning improvements and to test their implementation. Finally, section 6 concludes. Tree-based Taggers Decision trees have been successfully applied to a number of different NLP problems and, in particular, in POS tagging they have proven to be an efficient and compact way of capturing the relevant information for disambiguating. See (MSxquez, 1999) for a broad survey on this issue. In this approach to tagging, the ambiguous words in the training corpus are divided into classes corresponding to the sets of tags they can take (i.e, 'noun-adjective', 'noun-adjectiveverb', etc.). These sets are called ambiguity classes and a decision tree is acquired for each of them. Afterwards, the tree-base is applied in a particular disambiguation algorithm. Regarding the learning algorithm, we use a particular implementation of a top-down induction of decision trees (TDIDT) algorithm, belonging to the supervised learning family. This algorithm is quite similar to the well-known CART (Breiman et al., 1984), and C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) , but it incorporates some particularities in order to better fit the domain at hand. Training examples are collected from annotated corpora and they consist of the target word to be disambiguated and some information of its local context in the sentence. All words not present in the training corpus are considered unknown. In principle, we have to assume that they can take any tag corresponding to open categories (i.e., noun, proper noun, verb, adjective, adverb, cardinal, etc.) , which sum up to 20 in the Penn Treebank tagset. In this approach, an additional ambiguity class for unknown words is considered, and so, they are treated exactly in the same way as the other ambiguous words, except by the type of information used for acquiring the trees, which is enriched with a number of morphological features. Once the tree-model has been acquired, it can be used in many ways to disambiguate a real text. In the following sections, 2.1 and 2.2, we present two alternatives. RTT: A Reductionistic Tree-based Tagger RTT is a reductionistic tagger in the sense of Constraint Grammars (Karlsson et al., 1995) . In a first step a word-form frequency dictionary provides each input word with all possible tags with their associated lexical probability. After that, an iterative process reduces the ambiguity (discarding low probable tags) at each step until a certain stopping criterion is satisfied. More particularly, at each step and for each ambiguous word (at a sentence level) the work performed in parallel is: 1) The target word is \"passed\" through its corresponding decision tree; 2) The resulting probability distribution is used to multiplicatively update the probability distribution of the word; and 3) The tags with very low probabilities are filtered out. For more details, we refer the reader to (Mgrquez and Rodrfguez, 1997). STT: A Statistical Tree-based Tagger The aim of statistical or probabilistic tagging (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992) is to assign the most likely sequence of tags given the observed sequence of words. For doing so, two kinds of information are used: the lexical probabilities, i.e, the probability of a particular tag conditional on the particular word, and the contextual probabilities, which describe the probability of a particular tag conditional on the surrounding tags. Contextual (or transition) probabilities are usually reduced to the conditioning of the preceding tag (bigrams), or pair of tags (trigrams), however, the general formulation allows a broader definition of context. In this way, the set of acquired statistical decision trees can be seen as a compact representation of a rich contextual model, which can be straightforwardly incorporated inside a statistical tagger. The point here is that the context is not restricted to the n-1 preceding tags as in the n-gram formulation. Instead, it is extended to all the contex-tual information used for learning the decision trees. The Viterbi algorithm (described for instance in (Deaose, 1988) ),. in which n-gram probabilities are substituted by the application of the corresponding decision trees, allows the calculation of the most-likely sequence of tags with a linear cost on the sequence length. However, one problem appears when applying conditionings on the right context of the target word, since the disambiguation proceeds from left to right and, so, the right hand side words may be ambiguous. Although dynamic programming can be used to Calculate the most likely sequence of tags to the right (in a forward-backward approach), we use a simpler approach which consists of calculating the contextual probabilities by a weighted average of all possible tags for the right context. Additionally, the already presented tagger allows a straightforward incorporation of n-gram probabilities, by linear interpolation, in a backoff approach including, from most general to most specific, unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and decision trees. From now on, we will refer to STT as STT + when using n-gram information. Due to the high ambiguity of unknown words, their direct inclusion in the statistical tagger would result in a severe decreasing of performance. To avoid this situation, we apply the tree for unknown words in a pre-process for filtering low probable tags. In this way, when entering to the tagger the average number of tags per unknown word is reduced from 20 to 3.1. 3 Evaluation of the Taggers Domain of Application We have used a portion of about 1,17 Mw of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, tagged according to the Penn Treebank tag set (45 different tags). The corpus has been randomly partitioned into two subsets to train (85%) and test (15%) the system. See table 1 for some details about the used corpus. The training corpus has been used to create a word form lexicon --of 45,469 entries--with the associated lexical probabilities for each word. The training corpus contains 239 different ambiguity classes, with a number of examples ranging from few dozens to several thousands (with a maximum of 34,489 examples for the preposition-adverb-particle ambiguity). It is noticeable that only the 36 most frequent ambiguity classes concentrate up to 90% of the ambiguous occurrences of the training corpus. Training examples for the unknown-word ambiguity class were collected from the training corpus in the following way: First, the training corpus is randomly divided into twenty parts of equal size. Then, the first part is used to extract the examples which do not occur in the remaining nineteen parts, that is, taking the 95% of the corpus as known and the remaining 5% to extract the examples. This procedure is repeated with each of the twenty parts, obtaining approximately 22,500 examples from the whole corpus. The choice of dividing by twenty is not arbitrary. 95%-5% is the proportion that results in a percentage of unknown words very similar to the test set (i.e., 2.25%) 2 . Finally, the test set has been used as completely fresh material to test the taggers. All results on tagging accuracy reported in this paper have been obtained against this test set. Results In this experiment we used six basic discretevalued features to disambiguate know n ambiguous words, which are: the part-of-speech tags of the three preceding and two following words, and the orthography of the word to be disambiguated. For tagging unknown words, we used 20 attributes that can be classified into three groups: \u2022 Contextual information: part-of-speech tags of the two preceding and following words. \u2022 Orthographic and Morphological information (about the target word): prefixes (first two symbols) and suffixes (last three symbols); Length; Multi-word?; Capitalized?; Other capital letters?; Numerical characters?; Contain dots? \u2022 Dictionary-related information: Does the target word contains any known word as a prefix (or a suffix)?; Is the target word :See (M\u00a3rquez, 1999) for a discussion on the appropriateness of this procedure. The last group of features are inspired in those applied by Brill (1995) when addressing unknown words. The learning algorithm 3 acquired, in about thirty minutes, a base of 191 trees (the other ambiguity classes had not enough examples) which required about 0,68 Mb of storage. The results of the taggers working with this tree-base is presented in table 3. MFT stands for a baseline most-frequent-tag tagger. RTT, STT, and STT + stand for the basic versions of the taggers presented in section 2. The overall accuracy is reported in the first column. Columns 2, 3, and 4 contain the tagging accuracy on some specific groups of words: unknown words, ambiguous words (excluding unknown words) and known words which is the complementary of the set of unknown words. Column 5 shows the speed of each tagger 4 and, finally, the 'Memory' column reflects the size of the used language model (the lexicon is not considered). Three main conclusions can be extracted: \u2022 RTT and STT approaches obtain almost the same results in accuracy, however RTT is faster. ZThe programs were implemented using PERL-5.0 and they were run on a SUN UltraSparc2 machine with 194Mb of RAM. 4More than absolute figures what is important here is the performance of each tagger relative to the others. 5TT obtains better results when it incorporates bigrams and trigrams, with a slight time-space penalty. The accuracy of all taggers is comparable to the best state-of-the art taggers under the open vocabulary assumption (see section 5.2). Machine-Learning-based Improvements Our purpose is to improve the performance on two types of ambiguity classes, namely: Most frequent ambiguity classes. We focused on the 26 most representative classes, which concentrate the 86% of the ambiguous occurrences. From these, eight (24.1%) were already resolved at almost 100% of accuracy, while the remaining eighteen (61.9%) left some room for improvement. Section 4.1 explain which methods have been applied to construct ensembles for these eighteen classes plus the unknown-word ambiguity class. Boosting (Freund and Schapire, 1995) , Bagging (Breiman, 1996) , and Cross-validated Committees (Parmanto et al., 1996) ; 2) Combining different input features (Cherkauer, 1996; Tumer and Ghosh, 1996) ; 3) Changing output representation, e.g. ECOC (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995) and PWC-CC (Moreira and Mayoraz, 1998) ; and 4) Injecting randomness (Dietterich, 1998) . Ambiguity classes with few examples. We tested several of the preceding methods on our domain. Below, we briefly describe those that reported major benefits. 4.i.1 Bagging (BAG) From a training set of n examples, severaI samples of the same size are extracted by randomly drawing, with replacement, n times. Such new training sets are called bootstrap replicates. In each replicate, some examples appear multiple times, while others do not appear. A classifier is induced from each bootstrap replicate and then they are combined in a voting approach. The technique is called bootstrap aggregation, from which the acronym bagging is derived. In our case, the bagging approach was performed following the description of Breiman (1996) , constructing 10 replicates for each data set 5. Combining Feature Selection Criteria, (FSC) In this case, the idea is to obtain different classifiers by applying several different functions for feature selection inside the tree induction algorithm. In particular, we have selected a set of seven functions that achieve a similar accuracy, namely: Gini Impurity Index, Information Gain and Gain Ratio, Chi-square statistic (X2), Sym-metrical Tau criterion, RLM (a distance-based method), and a version of RELIEF-F which uses the Information Gain function to assign weights to the features. The first five are described, for instance, in (Sestito and Dillon, 1994) , RLM is due to LSpez de M\u00a3ntaras (1991), and, finally, RELIEF-F is described in (Kononenko et al., 1995) . Since the applied feature selection functions are based on different principles, we expect to obtain biased classifiers with complementary information. Combining Features (FCOMB) We have extended the basic set of six features with lexical information about words appearing in the local context of the target word, and with the ambiguity classes of the same words. In this way, we consider information about the surrounding words at three different levels of specificity: word form, POS tag, and ambiguity class. Very similar to Brill's lexical patterns (Brill, 1995) , we also have included features to capture collocational information. Such features are obtained by composition of the already described single attributes and they are sequences of contiguous words and/or POS tags (up to three items). The resulting features were grouped according to their specificity to generate ensembles of eight trees 6. The idea here is that specific information (lexical attributes and collocational patterns) would produce classifiers that cover concrete cases (hopefully, with a high precision), while more general information (POS tags) would produce more general (but probably less precise) trees. The combination of both type of trees should perform better because of the complementarity of the information. 5Several authors indicate that most of the potential improvement provided by bagging is obtained within the first ten replicates. 6The features for dealing with unknown words were combined in a similar way to create ensembles of 10 trees. For details, see (M\u00a3rquez, 1999) . Generating Pseudo-Examples (CPD) Breiman (1998) , describes a simple and effective method for generating new pseudo-examples fl'om existing data and incorporating them into a tree-based learning algorithm to increase prediction accuracy in domains with few training exalnples. We call this method CPD (standing for generation of Convex Pseudo-Data). The method for obtaining new data from the old is similar to the process of gene combination to create new generations in genetic algorithms. First, two examples of the same class are selected at random from the training set. Then, a new example is generated from them by selecting attributes from one or another parent according to a certain probability. This probability depends on a single generation parameter (a real number between 0 and 1), which regulates the amount of change allowed in the combination step. In the original paper, Breiman does not propose any optimization of the generation parameter, instead, he performs a limited amount of trials with different values and simply reports the best result. In our domain, we observed a big variance on the results depending on the concrete values of the generation parameter. Instead of trying to tune it, we generate several training sets using different values of the generation parameter and we construct an ensemble of decision trees. In this way, we make the global classifier independent of the particular choice, and we generally obtain a combined result which is more accurate than any of the individuals. Experiments and Results Constructing and Evaluating Ensembles First, the three types of ensembles were applied to the 19 selected ambiguity classes in order to decide which is the best in each case. The evaluation was performed by means of a 10-fold cross-validation ,using the training corpus. The obtained results confirm that all methods contribute to improve accuracy in almost all domains. The absolute improvement is not very impressive but the variance is generally very low and, so, the gain is statistically significant in the majority of cases. Summarizing, BAG wins in 8 cases, FCOMB in 9, and FSC in 2 (including the unknown-word class). These results are reported in table 4 , in which the error rate of a single basic tree is compared to the results of the ensembles for each ambiguity class r. The last column presents the percentage of error reduction for the best method in each row. Second, CPD was applied to the 82 selected ambiguity classes, with positive results in 59 cases, from which 25 were statistically significant (again in a 10-fold cross-validation experiment). These 25 classes agglutinate 20,937 examples and the error rate was diminished, o11 average, from 20.16% to 18.17%. Tagging with the Enriched Model Ensembles of classifiers were learned for the ambiguity classes explained in the previous sections using the best technique in each case. These ensembles were included in the tree-base, used by the basic taggers of section 3, substituting the corresponding individual trees, and both taggers were tested again using the enriched model. At runtime, the combination of classifiers was done by averaging the results of each individual decision tree. In order to test the relative improvement of each component, the inclusion of the ensembles is performed in three steps: 'CPD ~ stands for the ensembles for infrequent ambiguity classes, 'ENS' stands for the ensembles for frequent ambiguity classes and unknown words, and 'CPD-~ENS' stands for the inclusion of both. Results are described in table 5 . Some important conclusions are: \u2022 The best result of each tagger is significantly better than each corresponding basic version, and the accuracy consistently grows as more components are added. \u2022 The relative improvement of STT + is lower than those of RTT and STT, suggesting than the better the tree-based model is, the less relevant is the inclusion of n-gram information. \u2022 The special treatment of low frequent ambiguity classes results in a very small contribution, indicating that there is no much 7These figures are calculated by averaging the resu|ts of the ten folds.   to win from these classes, unless we were able to fix their errors in a much greater proportion than we really did. \u2022 The price to pay for the enriched models is a substantial overhead in storage requirement and speed decreasing, which in the worst case is divided by 5. In order to compare our results to others, we list in table 6 the results reported by several state-of-the-art PO5 taggers, tested on the WSJ corpus with the open vocabulary assumption. In that table, TBL stands for Brill's transformation-based error-driven tagget (Brill, 1995) , ME stands for a tagger based on the ma\u00d7imum entropy modelling (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) , SPATTER stands for a statistical parser based on decision trees (Magerman, 1996) , IGTREE stands for the memory-based tagger by Daelemans et al. (1996) (Brill and Wu, 1998) . Comparing to all the individual tuggers we observe that our approach reports the highest accuracy, and that it is comparable to that of YComb obtained by the combination of three tuggers. This is encouraging, since we have improved an individual POS tagger which could be further introduced as a better component in an ensemble of tuggers. Unfortunately, the performance on unknown words is difficult to compare, since it strongly depends on the used lexicon. For instance, IGTREE does not include in the lexicon the numbers appearing in the training set, and, so, any number in the test set is considered unknown (they report an unusually high percentage of Unknown words: 5.5% compared to our 2.25%). The fact that numbers are very easy to recognize could explain their outstanding results on tagging unknown words. ME also reports a higher percentage of unknown words, 3.2%, \u2022 while TBL says nothing about this issue. 6 Conclusions and Further Work In this paper, we have applied several ML techniques for constructing ensembles of classifiers to address the most representative and/or difficult cases of ambiguity within a decision-treebased English POS tagger. As a result, the overall accuracy has been significantly improved. Comparing to other approaches, we see that our tagger performs better on the WSJ corpus and under the open vocabulary assumption, than a number of state-of-the-art POS tuggers, and similar to another approach based on the combination of several tuggers s. 8However, it has to be said that the pure statistical or machine-learning based approaches to POS tagging still significantly underperform some sophisticated manually constructed systems, such as the English shallow parser based on Constraint Grammars developed at the Helsinki University (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997) . The cost of this improvement has been quantiffed in terms of storage requirement and speed of the resulting enriched tuggers. Of course, there exists a clear tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency which should be resolved on the basis of the user needs. Although all proposed techniques are fully automatic, it has to be said that the construction of appropriate ensembles requires a significant human and computational effort. There are several features that should be further studied with respect to the used methods for constructing the ensembles of decision trees, the way they are combined and included in the tuggers, etc. However, we are now more interested on experimenting with the inclusion of our tagger as a component in an ensemble of preexisting tuggers, in the style of (Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al., 1998) . More generally, one may think that, after all the involved effort, the achieved improvement seems small. On this particular, we think that we are moving very close to the best achievable results using fully statistically-based techniques, and that some kind of specific human knowledge should be jointly considered in order to achieve the next qualitative step. We also think that other issues than simply 'accuracy rates' are becoming more important in order to test and evaluate the real utility of different approaches for tagging. Such aspects, that should be studied in the near future, refer to the ability of adapting to new domains (tuning), the types of errors committed and their influence on the task at hand, the language independence assumption, etc. mission (EuroWordNet LE4003) and by the Acknowledgments This research has been partially funded by the Spanish Research Department (CICYT's ITEM project TIC96-1243-C03-02), by the EU Corn-Catalan Research Department (CIRIT's consolidated research group 1997SGR 00051, and CREL project).",
