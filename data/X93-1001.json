    "article": "TIPSTER PHASE I The task of TIPSTER Phase I was to advance the state of the art in two language technologies, Document Detection and Information Extraction. Document Detection includes two subtasks, routing (running static queries against a stream of new data), and retrieval (running ad hoc queries against archival data). Information Extraction is a technology in which prespecified types of information are located within free text, extracted, and placed within a database. THE STATE OF THE ART IN DOCUMENT DETECTION BEFORE TIPSTER Before TIPSTER users searching large volumes of data and using many queries had few information retrieval tools to use other than the boolean keyword search systems which had been developed more than a decade earlier. The characteristics of these boolean systems are: \u2022 low recall (the user loses an unknown quantity of useful information because the system is unable to retrieve many of the relevant documents) \u2022 low precision (the user has to read a very large number of irrelevant documents which the system has mistakenly retrieved) \u2022 no ranking or prioritization (the user must scan the entire list of retrieved documents because a good document is just as likely to be at the end of the list of retrieved documents as at the hesinning) \u2022 exact matches (the user must generate by hand variant spellings or alternate word choices because there are no built-in rules for adding variants) \u2022 hand built queries (the user has to understand how the system works and the syntax of queries in order to use the system) DOCUMENT DETECTION DELIVERABLES IN PHASE H As a result of algorithm development in Phase I, during TIPSTER Phase lI. prototype systems will be built, giving the user Document Detection tools which feature the technology developed in Phase I: \u2022 improved recall (comparative evaluation of systems in TIPSTER and TREC [1] has demonstrated higher recall of relevant documents) \u2022 improved precisica (the user will read fewer useless documents in order to find the ones he wants) \u2022 ranked retrievals (the user reviews documents statistically ranked according to how well they match the query, thus improving the chances that the most useful documents will be near the top of the queue) \u2022 query expansion (the system, not the user, automatically expands queries to draw in more relevant documents by using concept based tools such as tbesauri) \u2022 automatic query generation (the system uses a natural language description of the subject supplied by the user to generate queries) \u2022 language dependency (English only) \u2022 task dependency, solving a single problem with little reusability \u2022 high development cost with only system developer maintenance INFORMATION EXTRACTION DELIVERABLES IN PHASE H As a result of algorithm development in Phase I, during TIPSTER Phase H. prototype systems will be built with the following characteristics: \u2022 increased extensibility within domain with reduced user involvement \u2022 greater ease of portability to new different domains \u2022 language independence, portability to new languages \u2022 task independence, solving multiple problems with reusable components \u2022 user f~useed maintenance with minimal system developer involvement These systems provide the user with extraction tools which feature: \u2022 accurate and consistent database content results \u2022 minimal user intervention in reviewing extraction results \u2022 initial cost expenditure with little maintenance cost \u2022 flexibility in managing the amount of informatien to be ex~acted \u2022 appficability to new tasks, such as indications/warnings, text tagging, and document detection support [1] The Text REtrieval Conferences (TREC's) are described in the Document Detecfien section.",
