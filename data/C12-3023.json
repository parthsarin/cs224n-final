We introduce the CRAB Reader -a tool for the analysis and visualization of information structure (according to the Argumentative Zoning (AZ) scheme) in scientific literature which can facilitate efficient and user-friendly expert-annotation. We investigate and demonstrate the use of our tool for this purpose and also discuss the benefits of using the same tool to support practical tasks such as scientific literature review. Introduction There is a need to develop techniques that can help scientists locate and organize relevant information in rapidly growing scientific literature. Scientists have diverse information needs and are often interested in specific types of information in a paper. Although section headings (e.g. Methods, Results) can be an indicator of information categories of interest, many sections tend to include different types of information (e.g. the Discussion section may include information about methods and results and also provide a comparison against other peoples' work). An automatic analysis of the information category of each sentence is therefore important and can be useful for both natural language processing tasks as well as for scientists e.g. conducting literature review. Different approaches have been developed for determining the information structure (aka. discourse, rhetorical, argumentative or conceptual structure) of scientific publications (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Mizuta et al., 2006; Shatkay et al., 2008; Teufel et al., 2009; Liakata et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2010) . Some of this work has proved helpful for tasks such as information retrieval, information extraction, and summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Mizuta et al., 2006; Tbahriti et al., 2006; Ruch et al., 2007) . Most existing approaches are based on supervised learning and require large amounts of annotated data which limits their applicability to different domains . Recently (Guo et al., 2011b) has shown that weakly supervised learning (especially active learning) works well for determining the information structure of biomedical abstracts. This work is interesting since it can facilitate easier porting of the techniques to new tasks. However, also approaches based on weak supervision require data annotation in real-world applications. Moreover, simulation of active learning (such as that conducted by (Guo et al., 2011b) who used a fully annotated corpus from which they restored the labels of selected sentences in each iteration) is not practical but real-time interactive annotation is needed. This requires a development of an efficient and user-friendly annotation tool which can facilitate rapid expert-annotation of data according to categories of information structure in real-life scientific tasks. We introduce such a tool: the CRAB Reader -a tool that is capable of supporting not only off-line AZ annotation but also interactive AZ annotation through weakly supervised learning, along with visualization of information structure in scientific literature. The latter functionality can also be applied to support scientists in literature review. The CRAB 1 reader enables analyzing biomedical articles according to the Argumentative Zoning (AZ) scheme -a scheme of information structure that describes the rhetorical progression in scientific papers (Teufel and Moens, 2002) . However, since the AZ scheme has been shown to apply across different scientific domains (Teufel et al., 2009) , the technology presented here can be widely applicable. CRAB Reader The CRAB Reader allows users to define a new scheme or to modify an existing scheme for information structure analysis. Currently, we use the Argumentative Zoning (AZ) scheme which was originally introduced by Teufel and Moens (2002) and which was first used to describe the rhetorical progression of scientific argument in computational linguistics papers. This scheme was subsequently adapted to other domains such as chemistry (Teufel et al., 2009) and biology (Mizuta et al., 2006) . We adopt the latter version in our work, and use eight zone categories, including Background, Problem (the research question), Method, Result, Conclusion, Connection (consistent studies), Difference (inconsistent studies) and Future-work. Using the CRAB Reader, AZ annotation can be performed on each word, sentence, paragraph, or the entire document, depending on the requirement. Annotated papers are saved in the HTML format. Users can visualize zones in different colors in an annotated paper. CRAB Reader also supports interactive annotation which is useful for weakly supervised learning when used in conjunction with a classifier such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). More specifically, a classifier makes a request for the labels of particular sentences; in response to such a request, CRAB Reader presents the relevant sentences to the annotators, collects their annotations, and returns the labeled sentences to the classifier for further learning. Importing articles Users can import any paper in HTML format into CRAB Reader. Since the format of articles varies from journal to journal, an HTML paper needs to be transformed into XML and then formatted using XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations). Users need to define different style sheets for different journals. For example, the code in Figure 1 shows how to separate an abstract from the body of an article (see the <xsl:if> element), and how to format a section/subsection/paragraph (see the <xsl:for-each> element) given an article from The Journal of Biological Chemistry, where an <h2> tag refers to a section, an <h3/4/5> tag refers to a subsection, and a <p> tag refers to a paragraph. Currently, CRAB Reader provides style sheets for main journals on chemical risk assessment, but it can handle papers from other domains by integrating more templates. Potentially, PDF papers can also be imported into CRAB Reader after converted into HTML files, and there are various (free) tools available for converting PDF to HTML. <xsl:for-each select=\"//div[@id='content-block']//div[@class='article fulltext-view']/div\"> <xsl:if test=\"contains(@class, 'section')-contains(@class, 'abstract')\"> <section> <heading> <xsl:value-of select=\"h2\"/> </heading> <xsl:for-each select=\"p|h3|h4|h5\"> <xsl:copy-of select=\".\"/> </xsl:for-each> </section> </xsl:if> </xsl:for-each> Off-line annotation Off-line annotation differs from interactive annotation in that users need to annotate an entire article instead of a small number of sentences selected by the machine. The off-line annotation tool in CRAB Reader is a Firefox plug-in written in XUL (XML User Interface Language). XUL is based on existing Web technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. Figure 2 shows how to use the tool in Firefox: users can select any amount of text by clicking where they want to begin, holding down the left mouse button, and then dragging the pointer over the text. Right-clicking the selected text opens a menu of zone categories such as Result, Conclusion, and so on. Users can then choose the appropriate category for annotation. The annotations are Interactive annotation via active learning Interactive annotation is based on a client/server model, where a client (annotator) makes a request for a new assignment (unlabeled sentences); the server then trains classifiers on existing labeled data, and compares their performance on each unlabeled data, from which it selects the most informative sentences as a new assignment for the annotator. After completing the assignment the annotator submits the annotations to the server. The server then updates the training data by incorporating the fresh labels for further learning. This process can be repeated many times that is called active learning. The idea of active learning is to create a high-performance classifier but to minimize the cost of annotation. On the server side we tested the most popular classifiers including Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Maximum Entropy Model, Conditional Random Fields, among many others, and SVM is so far the best classifier for this task. The features listed below were used for classification. Most of them have been successfully used in recent related work (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Mullen et al., 2005; Merity et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2011b) . The C&C POS tagger and parser (Curran et al., 2007) was used for extracting syntactic features such as grammatical relations (GR) from each sentence. Section. Normalized section names (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) . Location in article/section/paragraph. Each article/section/paragraph was divided into ten equal parts. Location was defined by the parts where the sentence begins and ends. Citation. The number of citations in a sentence (0, 1 or more). Table and Figure. The number of referred tables and figures in a sentence (0, 1 or more). N-gram. Any unigrams and bigrams in the corpus (an n-gram feature equals 1 if it is observed in the sentence and 0 if not; the rest of the features are defined in a similar way). Verb. Any verbs in the corpus. Verb Class. Verbs are grouped into 60 categories by spectral clustering (Sun and Korhonen, 2009) . Each category corresponds to a feature. Tense and Voice. Tense and voice indicated by the POS tag of main verbs and auxiliary verbs. e.g. have|VBZ be|VBN __|VBN indicates present perfect tense, passive voice. Grammatical Relation. Subject (ncsubj), direct object (dobj), indirect object (iobj) and second object (obj2) relations for verbs. e.g. (ncsubj observed difference obj). Subj/Obj. The subjects/objects appearing with any verbs in the corpus. We implemented a number of query strategies for SVM-based active learning, including least confident sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) , margin sampling (Scheffer et al., 2001) , query-bycommittee (Seung et al., 1992) , etc. The interactive annotation interface is a dynamic web page (HTML form) that presents a list of sentences selected by the server for human to annotate, as shown in Figure 3 . It also presents the context (in gray color) of each selected sentence (in blue color) to facilitate the annotation process. After a user completes the form and clicks on the submit button, the annotations are sent to a PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) file and then written to the server as the training data for further learning. The web page also records the annotation time for each sentence, which is a more appropriate measure of annotation effort compared to training set size. As an example, Figure 4 shows the results for real-time active learning on 50 biomedical articles. Although the curves on the left and right panels look very similar, CRAB Reader does offer an opportunity to evaluate the performance of active learning in a more natural way. Visualizing argumentative zones We use CSS to specify the look and format of an annotated paper. Zones have different colors as shown in Figure 5 . The zone label of any particular word will come up when you mouse over it, as shown in Figure 2 . The advantage of using CSS is that it provides more flexibility for the visualization of zones and allows the same annotated paper to be presented in different styles for different users (see Figure 6 ). Also, since CSS separates the format from the content of a document, it makes it easier to insert automatic annotations into plain text so that we can visualize the information structure of any paper on demand. Angiogenic Potential of 3-Nitro-4-Hydroxy Benzene Arsonic Acid (Roxarsone) Abstract Roxarsone (3-nitro-4-hydroxy benzene arsonic acid) is an arsenic compound widely used in the poultry industry as a feed additive to prevent coccidiosis, stimulate growth, and to improve tissue pigmentation. Little is known about the potential human health effects from roxarsone released into the environment from chicken waste or from residual compound in chicken products. The growth potentiation and enhanced tissue pigmentation suggest that low levels of roxarsone exposure may have an angiogenic potential similar to that of inorganic arsenite (AsIII). The goal of this investigation was to test the hypothesis described above using cultured human aortic and lung microvascular endothelial cells in high-content imaging tube-forming assays and begin developing a molecular level understanding of the process. We used a three-dimensional Matrigel assay for probing angiogenesis in cultured human endothelial cells, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array to probe the gene changes as a function of roxarsone or AsIII treatment. In addition, we used Western blot analysis for changes in protein concentration and activation. Roxarsone was found to exhibit a higher angiogenic index than AsIII at lower concentrations. Increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was observed for roxarsone but not for AsIII-induced angiogenesis. However, AsIII caused more rapid and pronounced phosphorylation of eNOS. Quantitative PCR array on select genes revealed that the two compounds have different and often opposite effects on angiogenic gene expression. The results demonstrate that roxarsone and AsIII promote angiogenic phenotype in human endothelial cells through distinctly different signaling mechanisms. Article Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a worldwide public health concern. The extent of the concern in some countries has reached a point such that some are calling this humanity's largest mass poisoning (Bhattacharjee 2007). Even low levels of exposure to arsenic have been linked to increased cardiovascular disease and hypertension (Chen et al. 2007; Navas Acien et al. 2005) . Although natural contamination of drinking water with inorganic arsenic represents the largest arsenical hazard to human health, environmental exposure to commercial organoarsenicals is a growing concern (Sapkota et al. 2007 ). Organoarsenicals such as roxarsone are widely used by the poultry industry (Arai et al. 2003; Brown et al. 2004; Chapman et al. 2002) , with approximately 2.2 million pounds of roxarsone being fed to broiler chickens raised in the United States per year (Garbarino et al. 2003) . The majority of roxarsone is excreted unchanged from chickens (Morrison 1969), while the remainder increases the total arsenic present in chicken tissue (Lasky et al. 2004 ). This residual roxarsone could amount to ingestion of 1.38-5.24 mg/day of arsenic at mean levels of chicken consumption (60 g/person/day) (Wallinga 2006). The excreted roxarsone may pose an environmental hazard, as microbes, including those residing in the gut microflora, can release inorganic arsenite (AsIII) from roxarsone (Stolz et al. 2007 ). The human health impacts of roxarsone have not been well studied, and the mechanisms for its biological effects in mammalian tissues are unknown. It has been suggested, however, that all of these biological effects require metabolism to inorganic AsIII (O'Connor et al. 2005) . In a variety of in vivo and in vitro models, nanomolar or low micromolar concentrations of arsenic (AsIII) stimulate angiogenesis and vascular remodeling that may promote vascular diseases and tumorigenesis (Kamat et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2006; Soucy et al. 2003 Soucy et al. , 2005)) . In addition to enhancing tumor growth, increased angiogenesis would contribute to overall growth potential and increased tissue pigmentation. These are the attributes of roxarsone that contribute to its widespread use; however, the cellular effects of roxarsone to mammalian cells are not known. Further, it is unclear whether the vascular effects of roxarsone are dependent on its metabolism to inorganic arsenic. Herein we report the angiogenic potential of roxarsone and compare it with that of inorganic arsenite (AsIII). In addition, we report different modes of action of these two compounds in promoting angiogenesis. Materials and Methods Culture of endothelial cells Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) (Clonetics; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) were cultured at 5% CO2 in complete MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), 1% pen/strep, 1% hydrocortisone, 2 mM l-glu-tamine, and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Under these conditions up to 10 \u03bcM roxarsone was not cytotoxic, as determined by dye exclusion assays, whereas AsIII was toxic at 10 \u03bcM but not at 5 \u03bcM (Barchowsky et al. 1999a). Cells were used at passages 6-7 in three-dimensional Matrigel matrix cultures to probe the angiogenic potential (tube formation) of roxarsone and AsIII. Three-dimensional angiogenic tube-formation assay Concentration-responsive effects of roxarsone and AsIII on the angiogenic potential of HAEC and HMVEC were compared in quantitative high-content cellular imaging tube-formation assays in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Cells were incubated for 24 hr in reduced serum and growth factor MCDB 131 (1:5 dilution of complete MCDB 131 with nonsupplemented MCDB 131). The cells were then released from the culture dish with trypsin, diluted in MCDB 131 with or without inhibitors, and 6,000-10,000 cells were plated onto 35-mL Matrigel cushions in 96-well plates. Sodium arsenite (AsIII)) or roxarsone was then added from 1,000\u00d7 stock solutions. As positive controls for angiogenic tube formation, either vascular endothelial growth factor (1 ng/mL) or a cocktail of growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, 10 ng/mL; fibro-blast growth factor, 10 ng/mL; erythropoietin, 2 U/mL; and interleukin-6, 10 ng/mL) were added to the cultures. After 16 hr, the medium was removed and the gels were air dried. Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin and 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to stain F-actin and nuclei, respectively. Images of fluorescently labeled cells were collected with a Thermo Scientific Cellomics ArrayScan HCS Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and analyzed by an automated algorithm that identified the tubes formed by the association and clustering of the endothelial cells. This algorithm provided quantitative measurements of tube properties such as the number of tubes, tube lengths, tube areas, number of nodal branch points, and the angiogenic index-defined as the percentage of image area covered by tubes multiplied by 10 (Ghosh et al. 2007; Grove and Ghosh 2006) . Each experiment was repeated 3 times, and each treatment was probed in at least six wells. Differences between treatments were analyzed by one-and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett or Bonferroni post hoc tests for significance using Graphpad Prism v4.0 software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). SuperArray Angiogenesis RT2 Profiler PCR array The effects of 24-hr exposures to AsIII and roxarsone on HMVEC mRNA levels for 84 angiogenic and 5 constitutive genes were measured using the SuperArray quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD, USA). Total RNA was extracted from approximately 500,000 cells using QIAGEN RNeasy (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, TN, USA) mini kits with inclusion of a DNase treatment step. First-strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR with SYBR green master mix was performed in an Opticon 2 DNA engine (BioRad Corp., Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western analysis Western blot analysis was performed on proteins isolated from HAEC exposed to AsIII or roxarsone for 0.5, 1, or 4 hr. The proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene membranes, as previously described (Barchowsky et al. 1999b ). Blots were probed with primary antibody to either total or ser1177 phosphorylated eNOS (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA) and reacted bands were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence substrates (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA). Density of bands on film exposed to blots was determined using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD, USA). Figures and Tables Results and Discussion Concentration-responsive effects of roxarsone and AsIII on the angiogenic potential of HAEC and HMVEC were compared in quantitative high-content cellular imaging tube-formation assays in Matrigel (Figure 1 ). Images of fluorescently labeled cells were analyzed by an algorithm that identified the angiogenic tubes formed by the association and clustering of the endothelial cells and quantitatively measured the properties of the identified tubes such as the number of tubes, tube lengths, tube areas, number of nodal branch points, and the angiogenic index. The angiogenic index is defined as the percentage of image area covered by tubes multiplied by 10 (Ghosh et al. 2007; Grove and Ghosh 2006) . Both compounds were as effective as vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) in increasing the angiogenic index above the value for untreated control cells in both cell types (Figures 1 and 2 ). Both cell types exhibited strong angiogenic responses with the arsenical treatments; however, the HMVEC showed a higher basal level of angiogenesis (Table 1 ). Because of their lower basal angiogenic activity, HAEC were used for additional mechanistic studies. The angiogenic threshold for roxarsone was between 0.001 and 0.01 \u03bcM, an order of magnitude lower than the threshold for AsIII (Figures 1 and 2 ). As we have previously shown in in vivo chicken allantoic membrane angiogenesis assays (Soucy et al. 2003) , above 1 \u03bcM AsIII becomes toxic to tube formation and inhibits angiogenesis (Figure 2 ). In contrast, even 10 \u03bcM roxarsone showed no decrease in the angiogenic index (Figures 1 and 2 ) or signs of toxicity in the endothelial cells (data not shown). The fact that the efficacy for tube formation was similar, but the toxic potential differs, suggested that the two arsenicals differ in their mechanisms of action. Nitric oxide (NO) production is required for certain stimuli to promote angiogenesis (Yu et al. 2005 ), but AsIII is known to promote reactive oxygen that limits available NO release in endothelial cells (Barchowsky et al. 1999a , Bunderson et al. 2006) . The data in Figure 3 demonstrate that roxarsone requires NO generation to increase angiogenesis. Its effects were blocked by the eNOS inhibitor l-NG-nitroarginine methylester (L-NAME), but not its inactive enantiomer d -NG-nitroarginine methylester (D-NAME). In contrast, both NAME enantiomers prevented AsIII from increasing the angiogenic index. This would suggest either that AsIII inhibition by NAME was a nonstereospecific chemical effect or that D-NAME interacted with AsIII in a unique manner relative to roxarsone. Thus, roxarsone and inorganic AsIII appeared to have differential effects on signaling for NO-mediated angiogenesis. To investigate a possible mechanism for increased eNOS activity after exposure to arsenicals, we exposed HAEC to either roxarsone or AsIII for 0.5-4 hr, then probed for levels of serine phosphorylated eNOS relative to total eNOS. As shown in Figure 4 , both arsenicals caused time-dependent increases in Ser1177 phosphorylation of eNOS. However, roxarsone caused a progressive increase over 4 hr, whereas AsIII caused a rapid stimulation of phosphorylation that was declining by 4 hr. These data indicate that the arsenicals do not share similar common upstream signaling actions that enhance the activity of AKT, a serine/threonine protein kinase, which commonly accounts for serine phosphorylation (Dimmeler et al. 1999; Fulton et al. 1999 ). In addition, the time course for the effects of AsIII is consistent with its known ability to stimulate vascular NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide that quenches NO to form peroxynitrite (Bunderson et al. 2002; Lynn et al. 2000; Smith et al. 2001 ). These oxidants often mediate inflammatory angiogenesis (Ushio-Fukai and Alexander 2004) and thus may account for the mechanism of action for AsIII. Analysis of the effects of the two arsenicals on angiogenic gene activity further indicated that roxarsone and AsIII signal through distinct but overlapping mechanisms. Superarray quantitative PCR arrays of total RNA extracts from HMVEC treated with either arsenical for 24 hr demonstrated that the arsenicals differentially affect expression of a limited set of 9 of 84 inducible genes measured. AsIII induced more genes than it inhibited (Table 2 ). At 0.1 \u03bcM, roxarsone inhibited more genes than it induced (Table 2 ). Several genes were affected in the same direction, but not to the same degree by the two agents. Both arsenicals decreased angiogenic repressive interferon 1\u03b1 (Strieter et al. 2005 ) and interferon-inducible CXCL9 transcripts. It was interesting that generally the higher roxarsone concentration (1.0 \u03bcM) had either no effect on gene expression or the opposite effect of the low concentration. The exception was the concentration-dependent induction of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA levels by both roxarsone concentrations. AsIII also strongly induced HGF transcripts. It is difficult to reconcile the differential effects of AsIII and the two concentrations of roxarsone on gene expression with their concentration-dependent effects on angiogenic potential. It is possible that induction of a dominant factor, such as HGF, accounted for the observed increases in tube formation. However, the analysis was limited by the small number of gene changes measured and a lack of information regarding protein changes that may account for increased angiogenic index. Although beyond the scope of the current studies, additional mechanistic experiments would delineate the linkage between any gene or protein change and increased angiogenic index after arsenical exposure. Nonetheless, these data demonstrate that roxarsone and inorganic AsIII signal through different mechanisms to affect induction of genes that regulate angiogenesis. Conclusion Our results in human endothelial cell cultures demonstrate that roxarsone was a more potent inducer of angiogenesis than inorganic AsIII, and that roxarsone and AsIII signal through separate pathways to promote angiogenesis. The arsenicals had different time courses for phosphorylating eNOS; only the effects of roxarsone were blocked specifically by eNOS inhibition, and the two arsenicals differentially affected angiogenic gene induction. In addition to these differential effects, the fact that roxarsone is more potent for tube formation and less cytotoxic supports the conclusion that metabolism to inorganic AsIII cannot account for its vascular effects. More importantly, this was the first demonstration of functional vascular effects of roxarsone that may implicate a disease risk. Future studies are needed to demonstrate the mechanisms that enable differential signaling by the two arsenicals and the impact of this signaling in human endothelial cells on vascular disease promoted by their environmental exposures. found that workers who were cumulatively exposed to BD at higher rates also faced a significantly higher risk of chromosome damage , when compared with less exposed workers and with unexposed controls . Among Chinese BD-exposed workers , the genotypes XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp , XRCC1 280 Arg/His , XRCC1 399 Arg/Gln , XRCC1 77 T/C and ADPRT 762Ala/Ala were each associated with increased MN frequency . In addition , workers carrying the XRCC1 TCGA/TCGA diplotype were also associated with greater chromosome damage . Our exposure assessment data showed that PBL operational sites had the highest concentration . Similarly , Hayes et al . ( 13 ) measured exposure levels in a butadiene polymer production facility in China , the exposure range in polymer analysts was from below detection to 2382 mg/m3 . Moreover , industrials exceeded exposure to butadiene in other countries were also reported ( 2 ) . Consistent with previous studies ( 14,15 ) , our study found that there was no significant effect of smoking or alcohol drinking on MN frequency . The most plausible interpretation for this lack of association is that the magnitude of association with BD exposure was so strong that relationships with smoking or alcohol drinking were masked . Alternatively , blood concentrations of cigarette smoke or alcohol-related genotoxins may have been too low to cause chromosomal damage in lymphocytes ( 16 ) . Previous epidemiologic studies have investigated the effect of various lifestyle and biological factors on MN frequency in human lymphocytes . The most consistent demographic variable influencing the MN frequency was age , with MN frequency increasing significantly with age ( 17 ) . However , our results indicated that there was no significant increase in MN frequency among older workers compared with younger workers and no significant difference between female and male workers . A possible reason for these findings may be the limited number of older and female workers in this study . In our study , BD-exposed workers carrying the XRCC1 280 Arg/His and His/His genotypes were found to carry a higher chromosome damage than other who did not carry these genotypes . Previous research that investigated XRCC1 polymorphisms and their association with DNA repair capacity reported that only the variant proteins associated with the XRCC1 280 His allele is defective in the efficient localization of the protein to a damaged site in the chromosome , thereby reducing BER efficiency ( 22 ) . Because XRCC1 Arg280His is located close to sequences that mediate protein-protein interactions with ADPRT and DNA polymerase \u03b2 ( 23-25 ) , this protein may be involved in the formation of unstable chromosomal aberrations ( 26 ) . Several studies ( 27-29 ) have found an association between the presence of the variant genotypes of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and reduced DNA repair capacity , including data showing increased MN frequency . Three studies ( 30-32 ) all reported a significant increase in CA frequency in the presence of a variant allele of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism in benzene-exposed workers . However , others have reported no detrimental effect of variant XRCC1 399 Gln allele and XRCC1mediated repair ( 33-36 ) . In our study , worker exposed to BD and carrying the XRCC1 399 Arg/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes had higher chromosome damage compared with workers carrying the Arg/Arg genotype . Hao et al . ( 37 ) first reported the identification and association of genetic variants in XRCC1 -T77C and their associations with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . The C-allele-containing promoter has greater Sp1-binding affinity ( 38 ) . In our study , the XRCC1 -T77C polymorphism was associated with MN frequency in BD exposure workers . This finding is consistent with previous studies , which have reported an association between XRCC1 -T77C Conclusions and Future work We have introduced CRAB Reader, a convenient tool for analysis and visualization of AZ for scientific literature review. Particularly, CRAB Reader supports real-time interactive annotation which makes it possible to apply weakly supervised learning to AZ for different tasks and domains. The tool has been used for creating a corpus of 50 AZ-annotated articles (8171 sentences), and has proved successful for active learning-based AZ on that corpus with 82% accuracy after labeling 500 sentences, which is just 2% lower than the accuracy of fully supervised learning. In the future, we plan to use CRAB Reader for real-world applications of AZ such as question answering or customized summarization to speed up the literature review process. (Guo et al., 2011a) and (Guo et al., 2011c) have shown that users find the information in question from AZ-annotated abstracts significantly faster than from unannotated abstracts. However, is it realistic for full-text articles, given their high linguistic and informational complexity? We plan to conduct a similar question answering experiment to evaluate the usefulness of AZ-annotated articles in the context of a practical biomedical research task. We also plan to investigate whether AZ annotations are more informative than section headings for creating customized summaries for different research purposes.
