The motivation beyond our effort is that connectives can only be interpreted when they appear in context, that is, in a relation between the two fragments of text that constitute the two arguments of the relation. In this perspective, adding corpus examples annotated with connectives and arguments for the relation allows us to both extend the resource and validate the lexicon. In order to retrieve good corpus examples, we take advantage of the existing Contrast-Ita Bank (Feltracco et al., 2017) , a corpus of news annotated with explicit and implicit discourse contrast relations for Italian according to the annotation scheme proposed in the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) guidelines (Prasad et al., 2007) . We also use an extended -non contrast annotated-version of the same corpus and documents from Wikipedia. The resulting resource represents a valuable tool for both linguistic analyses of discourse relations and the training of a classifier for NLP applications. Introduction Discourse relations and the linguistic elements marking them in text, commonly referred to as discourse connectives, have recently been at the core of several annotation efforts for multiple languages (including English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, see Stede and Umbach (1998) , Roze et al. (2012) among others). In this paper, we present the results of the effort of enriching the preexisting resource LICO, a lexicon of Italian connectives retrieved from lexicographic sources (Feltracco et al., 2016) , with real corpus data, thus allowing us to both extend the resource and validate the lexicon. Our goal in this contribution is limited to the class of connectives marking contrast, and the additional relations such connectives might convey, some of them being polysemous. The motivation beyond our effort is that connectives can only be interpreted and disambiguated when they appear in context, that is, in a relation between the two fragments of text that constitute the two arguments of the relation. In order to retrieve good examples, we take advantage of the existing Contrast-Ita Bank (Feltracco et al., 2017) , a corpus of news annotated with explicit and implicit discourse contrast relations for Italian according to the annotation scheme proposed in the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) guidelines (Prasad et al., 2007) . Contrast-Ita Bank contains corpus annotations for 19 discourse connectives of contrasts, 14 of them are included in LICO; these provide the starting point for our work. We pick additional examples from the larger news corpus from which Contrast-Ita Bank is derived. The resulting resource represents a valuable tool for both linguistic analyses and the training of a classifier for NLP applications. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reports the definition of discourse connective we assume in our work. Section 3 introduces LICO and related lexica for other languages, while Section 4 reports the methodology and Section 5 presents the results of the effort of enriching the resource. The pa-per ends with concluding observations and hints for further work. Discourse connectives We define discourse connectives as lexical markers that are used to express relations between parts of the discourse. This definition is inspired by Ferrari (Ferrari and Zampese, 2000; Ferrari, 2010) : she defines a connective as \"each of the invariable forms [...], which introduce relations that structure \"logically\" the meanings of the sentence and of the text\" 1 . Ferrari clarifies that relations marked by connectives hold between events or assertions, and includes as arguments for the relation also nominalisations (e.g. \"after the pressing invitation ...'), i.e. cases that contain an event introduced through a nominal expression. On the other hand, she excludes those grammatical elements that introduce relative clauses or pronouns (as who in \"I don't know who you are.\") to be connectives. This is in line with the definition provided for the arguments of a connective in the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) 2.0 project, for which connectives relate two events, states, and propositions, that can be realized mostly as clauses, nominalisations, and anaphoric expressions (Prasad et al., 2007) . From this group are excluded general cue phrases or discourse markers, words/phrases that do not have the function of connectives but are used for instance to change the topic in a discourse or to initialize it, such as \"but\" in \"But, what are you doing?\". According to Ferrari (2010) , connectives belong to different syntactic classes, the same defined in the PDTB schema: i) subordinating conjunctions or subordinating expressions; ii) coordinating conjunctions or coordinating ex-pressions; iii) adverbs or adverbial expressions; iv) prepositions or prepositional expressions. In line with this definition, Stede (2012) distinguishes connectives as never inflected, closed-class lexical items, which belong to the above mentioned syntactic categories. He also specifies that these lexical elements can only be interpreted successfully when they appear in a relation between two discourse segments. Ferrari (2010) also proposes a non hierarchical classification for connectives depending on the \"type of logical relation they convey\", e.g. temporal and causal. The PDTB 3.0 project (Webber et al., 2016) proposes a hierarchical classification composed by three levels (Table 1 Table 1 : The PDTB 3.0 hierarchy of relations (Webber et al., 2016) . In the first level of the hierarchy, the class level, sense tags are grouped in four major classes (first column of Table 1 ). The second level of the hierarchy (second column of Table 1 ) specifies further the semantics of the class level: the type level. For example, the tag TEMPORAL.Synchronous indicates the type Synchronous of the class TEMPORAL and is used for connectives that indicate that the arguments of the relation are simultaneous (e.g. \"When she arrived, he was leaving\"); differently, the TEMPORAL.Asynchronous tag is used when the connective indicates a before-after relation (e.g. \"She arrived before he left\"). The third level, the subtype level (third column of Table 1 ), reflects the direction of the relations. For example, the type CONTIN-GENCY.Cause represents an asymmetric relation between two arguments: being one the cause, and the other the result. The subtype CONTINGENCY.Cause.Reason is used if the argument introduced by the connective (Arg2) is the reason for the situation in the other argument (Arg1) (e.g. \"I stayed at home because it was raining\"), while CONTIN-GENCY.Cause.Result is used if it represents the result/effect (e.g. \"It was raining, therefore I stayed at home\"). Notice that not every type has a further subtype: for example, the arguments involved in a temporal relation of type Synchronous do not play different roles and no subtype has been proposed. LICO: Lexicon for Italian Connectives According to our knowledge, LICO (Feltracco et al., 2016) , Lexicon for Italian COnnectives, is the highest coverage resource of discourse connectives available for Italian. Connectives in LICO. In LICO connectives are listed together with orthographic, syntactic, semantic information and also possible alignments with lexica of connectives in other languages. LICO is organized in 173 entries, each one corresponding to a connective and its orthographic or lexical variants. In fact, the invariability criterion proposed by Ferrari (2010) which does not include variable forms (i.e. those forms which are subject to morphological modifications) is partially dropped in LICO. Specifically, the resource does not include forms which exhibit morphological inflection or conjugation, but includes connectives which show a certain degree of lexical variability, that is, multiword expressions which are not totally rigid from a lexical point of view (e.g. ad esempio/per esempio 'for example' are both registered in the resource, as two variants of unique entry). Connectives in LICO are retrieved from three sources: i) the list of connectives mentioned by Ferrari for the entry connettivi 2 , ii) the list of connectives tagged as congiunzione testuale in Sabatini Coletti 2006 (Sabatini and Coletti, 2007) , except for the ones of literary use, and iii) the list of the equivalent Italian terms of the German connectives in the DimLex resource (Stede, 2002) (see Related Lexica). LICO Structure. For each entry LICO specifies: \u2022 possible lexical variants (e.g dopo di ch\u00e9 and dopo di ci\u00f2) and orthographic variants (e.g. ci\u00f2 nonostante and ciononostante); \u2022 whether the connective (or its variants) is composed by a single token or by more than one token; \u2022 whether the connective is composed by correlating parts (e.g. da una parte [..] dall'altra) or not (e.g. ciononostante); \u2022 the syntactic category: adverbs, prepositions, subordinating or coordinating conjunctions; \u2022 the semantic relation(s) which the connective indicates, according to the PDTB 3.0 schema of relations (Webber et al., 2016) ; \u2022 possible alignments with lexica of connectives in German; \u2022 examples of usage of the connective for each semantic relations it indicates. The examples in the first version of the resource are translation of the German examples already present in the DimLex resource (Scheffler and Stede, 2016; Stede, 2002; Stede and Umbach, 1998) . In adopting a corpus-based approach we aim at enriching LICO with data-driven examples and validating the information in the resource. Related lexica. LICO has been inspired by the Dim-Lex project for German (Scheffler and Stede, 2016; Stede, 2002; Stede and Umbach, 1998) (1) Il ministro del Lavoro e delle Pensioni britannico, Andrew Smith, ha rassegnato ieri le dimissioni nonostante i tentativi del premier Tony Blair di convincerlo a rimanere. 7 tag: CONCESSION.Arg1.as.denier In our work we take advantage of the information associated to the connectives of contrast in CIB. In fact, the annotated connective (marked as CONTRAST or CONCES-SION) together with its arguments constitute the examples we retrieved for the enrichment of LICO. For instance, Example (1) from CIB has been retrieved as an example of nonostante to enrich LICO. Moreover, we can get information of how the connective is used with reference to the relation it conveys; for example, we can inspect if it is found between the arguments it links, before them, if it requires a conjunctive form of the verb just in its arg2, etc... We keep this data in LICO by taking care of reporting the span of text of the two arguments as part of the example and by encoding the token id of the connective as registered in CIB: this works as a pointer for users who can reconstruct the entire annotation of the contrast relation in CIB. Corpus examples picking. Not all the connectives tagged as CONTRAST and CONCESSION in LICO are present in CIB, and the resource does not provide 5 examples for all the connectives of contrast it contains (some of them appear just once). Moreover, we want to retrieve examples also for the non contrastive use of the connectives, and these are not tagged in CIB. To reach our goal, we extend the search to other documents. On one hand, we con- text: \"La nostra idea -dice Rita -\u00e8 quella di aprire un bar normale. In cui il pubblico possa consumare anche qualche cibo precotto, patatine fritte, poi i soliti panini.

On the other hand, we search for additional examples in documents from Wikipedia 8 . While the retrieving has been done automatically, the selection of the examples has been conducted manually. This is because we need to distinguish cases in which the connective plays such a role from cases in which it does not introduce a discourse relation. These latter cases are also known as discourse markers already mentioned in Section 2, and are used, for instance, to take the turn in a conversation (interactive function) or as indicators of reformulation (metatextual function) -see (Bazzanella, 1995) and (Ferrari, 2010) . Once the connective is identified, we also need to disambiguate it, in order to associate it with the sense of the relation it is actually conveying. A manual annotation is thus needed for the creation of a resource of reference for both linguistic and computational uses. Results The results of our work will be presented in three sections considering that: the format used for registering the information in LICO has been updated since we introduce new elements; a new list of connectives has been created since we validated and modified the first version of LICO; a revision of the polysemy of the connectives has been carried out with the new data. The resulting format. Figure 1 shows the connective a dire la verit\u00e0 and its variants in LICO. In the central part of the figure, we can see how examples from the three different sources (i.e. CIB, Adige, Wikipedia) have been reported 8 Documents are from Italian Wikipedia, February 2010. in LICO. Specifically, the examples have their own id and are identified with the tag \"source\" which attribute is a two or three position code standing for: i) the source corpus (i.e. CIB or Adige or Wiki), ii) the source document id as identified in the source corpus, iii) just for example from CIB, the id of the tokens of the connective in the source document. For instance, in Figure 1 the first example is from document 405635 of CIB, and in that document the connective corresponds to tokens 185 and 186. Notice also that the source documents are distributed with LICO, as external material at users disposal. A new list of connectives of contrast. One important benefit of considering CIB, a corpus that has been exhaustively annotated with contrast relations, concerns the enrichment of the list of 38 connectives of contrast in LICO. As can be seen in Table 2 , five of the connectives tagged with CONTRAST or CONCESSION, or both relations, in CIB are not present in LICO. More precisely al contrario di and seppure were not present in LICO as connectives, while e, in realt\u00e0 and se were in LICO but associated to a non contrastive sense. On the other side, the corpus investigation bring us to eliminated 3 connectives from this list: con tutto questo, a onor del vero, persino. The three of them were found in the corpus as connectives but not conveying a contrast relation; they have been kept in LICO as connectives of the PDTB sense EXPANSION:Conjunction. 9 Table 2: Connectives of contrast in Contrast-Ita-Bank (CIB) and in LICO (L). Three were removed as they do not appear to convey the contrast relation. We thus update the list of connectives (of contrast) in LICO including the connectives form Contrast-Ita Bank and discarding those find not conveying this relation in the corpus; the final list is 40 connectives (38 in LICO -3 removed + 5 from CIB). This result, even limited, highlights the importance of a corpus investigation in order to enrich a lexical resource. Checking polysemy The use of corpora not only permits to discover new connectives of contrast or contrast uses of connectives that was already in LICO, but it lead us to review the polysemy of the already listed connectives of contrast. For example, we add the sense EXPANSION:Exception:Arg2-as-except to the connectives solamente and solo (both Eng. 'only') since we find example as the following, in which it introduces an exception. (2) L'attaccante quindi genera un certificato server falso, totalmente uguale al certificato vero, solamente che non \u00e8 firmato dalla stessa CA. 10   Table 3 shows the data of the enrichment. Notice that globvero) are in fact conveying the contrast relation; in context however, they seems to convey more the EXPANSION:Conjunction relation. For what concerns persino, it has been retrieved as a translation of the German auch which however, is not associated with the contrast relation in the DimLex lexicon; we do not find example for its use as contrastive. 10 Eng. \"The attacker then generates a fake server certificate, totally equal to the true certificate, only that it is not signed by the same CA.\" ally the average number of examples for each entry almost doubled, even though we added only two entries to the resource. As already specified, the corpus analysis also lead us to discover new senses for the connectives under examination (for a total of 214 senses over 175 entries with respect to the previous 205 over 173 connectives). Conclusion and Further works We have presented our project aiming at enriching the preexisting resource LICO (Feltracco et al., 2016) , a lexicon of discourse connectives for Italian, with real corpus data for connectives marking contrast. The adopted methodology partially takes advantage of a pre-existing resource in which discourse connectives of contrast are annotated, along with the arguments of the discourse relation they make esplicit. A complementary investigation has been conducted picking examples of the connectives in corpora and manually disambiguation their senses in the retrieved textual contexts. In particular, this latter strategy is replicable to enrich LICO with information about discourse connectives that convey relations other than contrast (e.g. temporal, causal) and it can also be adopted to enriched lexica of connectives in other language. Corpus investigation can also be carried out in a more automatic way: for example, Bourgonje et al. ( 2017 ) use parallel corpus to discover correspondences between connectives in different language and highlight point to gaps in the examined resources. In particular, the authors report on experiments to validate the list of connectives in Dim-Lex (Stede, 2002) and LICO in an effort to constructing a bilingual lexicon on connectives that are connected via their discourse senses. In our case, since we want to extract clear examples and disambiguate their senses in the context, we believe the manual disambiguation of connectives was necessary. The resulting resource represents a valuable tool for both linguistic analyses and the training of a classifier for NLP applications. Bibliographical References Asher , N. and Lascarides, A. (2003) .
