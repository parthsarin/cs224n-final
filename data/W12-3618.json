Close collaboration with Humanities scholars is essential to address these challenges. We discuss an annotation schema for Archaeological texts developed in collaboration with domain experts. Its development required a number of iterations to make sure all the most important entity types were included, as well as addressing challenges including a domain-specific handling of temporal expressions, and the existence of many systematic types of ambiguity. Introduction Content extraction techniques -so far, mainly used to analyse news and scientific publications -will play an important role in digital libraries for the humanities as well: for instance, certain types of browsing that content extraction is meant to support, such as entity, spatial and temporal browsing, could sensibly improve the quality of repositories and their browsing. However, applying content extraction to the Humanities requires addressing a number of problems: first of all, the lack of large quantities of data; then, the fact that entities in these domains, additionally to adhering to well established standards, also include very domain-specific ones. Archaeological texts are a very good example of the challenges inherent in humanities domains, and at the same time, they deepen the understanding of possible improvements content extraction yields for these domains. For instance, archaeological texts could benefit of temporal browsing on the basis of the temporal metadata extracted from the content of the publication (as opposed to temporal browsing based on the date of publication), more than biological publications or general news. In this paper, we discuss the development of a new annotation schema: it has been designed specifically for use in the archaeology domain to support spatial and temporal browsing. To our knowledge this schema is one of only a very few schemata for the annotation of archaeological texts (Byrne et al., 2010) , and Humanities domains in general (Martinez-Carrillo et al., 2012) (Agosti and Orio, 2011) . The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief description of the corpus and the framework in which the annotation has been developed; in Section 3, we describe a first annotation schema, analysing its performance and its weaknesses; in Section 4 we propose a revised version of the annotation schema, building upon the first experience and, in Section 5, we evaluate the performance of the new schema, describing a pilot annotation test and the results of the inter-annotator agreement evaluation. Framework and Corpus Description The annotation process at hand takes place in the framework of the development of the Portale della Ricerca Umanistica / Humanities Research Portal (PRU), (Poesio et al., 2011a) , a one-stop search facility for repositories of research articles and other types of publications in the Humanities. The portal uses content extraction techniques for extract-ing, from the uploaded publications, citations and metadata, together with temporal, spatial, and entity references (Poesio et al., 2011b) . It provides access to the Archaeological articles in the APSAT / ALPINET repository, and therefore, dedicated content extraction resources needed to be created, tuned on the specificities of the domain. The corpus of articles in the repository consists of a complete collection of the journal Preistoria Alpina published by the Museo Tridentino di Scienze Naturali. In order to make those articles accessible through the portal, they are tokenized, PoS tagged and Named Entity (NE) annotated by the TEXTPRO 1 pipeline (Pianta et al., 2008) . The first version of the pipeline included the default TEXTPRO NE tagger, Enti-tyPro, trained to recognize the standard ACE entity types. However, the final version of the portal is based on an improved version of the NEtagger capable of recognising all relevant entities in the AP-SAT/ALPINET collection (Poesio et al., 2011b; Ekbal et al., 2012) 3 Annotation Schema for the Archaeological Domain A close collaboration with the University of Trento's \"B. Bagolini\" Laboratory, resulted in the development of an annotation schema, particularly suited for the Archaeological domain, (Table 1 ). Differently from (Byrne et al., 2010) , the work has been particularly focused on the definition of specific archaeological named entities, in order to create very fined grained description of the documents. In fact, we can distinguish two general types of entities: contextual entities, those that are part of the content of the article (as PERSONs, SITEs, CULTUREs, ARTEFACTs), and bibliographical entities, those that refer to bibliographical information (as PubYEARs, etc.) (Poesio et al., 2011a) . In total, domain experts predefined 13 entities, and also added an underspecification tag for dealing with ambiguity. In fact, the archaeological domain is rich of polysemous cases: for instance, the term 'Fiorano' refers to a CULTURE, from the Ancient Neolithic, that takes its name from the SITE, 'Fiorano', which in turn is named from Fiorano Modenese; during the first annotation, those references were decided to be marked as underspecified. Annotation with the First Annotation Schema and Error Analysis A manual annotation, using the described schema, was carried out on a small subset of 11 articles of Preistoria Alpina (in English and Italian) and was used as training set for the NE tagger; the latter was trained with a novel active annotation technique (Vlachos, 2006) , (Settles, 2009) . Quality of the initial manual annotation was estimated using qualitative analyses for assessing the representativeness of the annotation schema, and quantitative analyses for measuring the inter-annotator agreement. Qualitative analyses revealed lack of specificity of the entity TIME and of the entity PERSON. In fact, the annotation schema only provided a general TIME entity used for marking historical periods (as Mesolitic, Neolithic) as well as specific dates (as 1200 A.D.) and proposed dates(as from 50-100 B.C.), although all these instances need to be clearly distinguished in the archaeological domain. Similarly, PERSON had been used for indicating general persons belonging to the document's contents and scientists working on the same topic (but not addressed as bibliographical references). For the inter-annotator agreement on the initial manual annotation, we calculated a kappa value of 0.8, which suggest a very good agreement. Finally, we carried out quantitative analyses of the  out to be mostly confused by the system. This result may be explained by the existence of many polysemous cases in the domain, that annotators used to mark as underspecified. This cross-error analysis revealed two main problems of the adopted annotation schema for Archaeological texts: 1) the lack of representativeness of the entity TIME and PERSON, used for marking concurrent concepts, 2) the accuracy problems due to the existence of underspecified entities. A Revised Annotation Schema and Coding Instructions Taking these analyses into consideration, we developed a new annotation schema (Table 2 ): the aforementioned problems of the previous section were solved and the first schema's results were outperformed in terms of accuracy and representativeness. The main improvements of the schema are: 1. New TIME and PERSON entities 2. New decision trees, aimed at overcoming underspecification and helping annotators in ambiguous cases. 3. New domain specific NE such as: material 4. Fine grained specification of ECOFACT: AninmalEcofact and BotanicEcofact. Similarly to (Byrne, 2006) , we defined more fine grained entities, in order to better represent the specificity of the domain; however, on the other hand, we also could find correlations with he CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (Crofts et al., 2011 ). 2 TIME and PERSON Entities Archaeological domain is characterized by a very interesting representation of time. Domain experts need to distinguish different kinds of TIME annotations. In some cases, C-14 analysis, on remains and artefacts, allow to detected very exact dating; those cases has been annotated as AbsTIME. On the other hand, there are cases in which different clues, given by the analysis of the settlements (technical skills, used materials, presence of particular species), allow archaeologists to detect a time frame of a possible dating. Those cases have been annotated as ProposedTime (eg. from 50-100 B.C). Finally, macro time period, such as Neolithic, Mesolithic, are annotated as HistoricalTIME: interestingly, those macro periods do not refer to an exact range of years, but their collocation in time depends on cultural and geographical factors. Coding Schema for Underspecified Cases In order to reduce ambiguity, and helping coders with underspecified cases, we developed the following decision trees: SITE vs LOCATION: coders are suggested to mark as LOCATION only those mentions that are clearly geographical references (eg. Mar Mediterraneo, Mediterranean Sea); SITE has to be used in all other cases (similar approach to the GPE markable in ACE); CULTURE vs TIME: a) coders are first asked to mark as HistoricalTIME those cases in which the mention belongs to a given list of macro period (such as Neolithic, Mesolithic): \u2022 eg.: nelle societa' Neolitiche (in Neolithic societies). b) If the modifier does not belong to that list, coders are asked to try an insertion test: della cultura + ADJ, (of the ADJ culture) : \u2022 lo Spondylus e' un simbolo del Neolitico Danubiano = lo Spondylus e' un simbolo della cultura Neolitica Danubiana (the Spondylus is a symbol of the Danubian Neolithic = the Spondylus is a symbol of the Danubian Neolithic culture). \u2022 la guerra fenicia != la guerra della cultura dei fenici (Phoenician war != war of the Phoenician culture). Finally, cases in which tests a) and b) fail, coders are asked to mark and discuss the case individually. Inter-Annotator Agreement and Evaluation To evaluate the quality of the new annotation schema, we measured the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) achieved during a first pilot annotation of two articles from Preistoria Alpina. The IAA was calculated using the kappa metric applied on the entities detected by both annotators, and the new schema reached an overall agreement of 0.85. In Table 3 entities regarding coordinates and time seem also to be well defined and representative. Conclusions In this study, we discuss the annotation of a very specific and interesting domain namely, Archaeology: it deals with problems and challenges common to many other domains in the Humanities. We have described the development of a fine grained annotation schema, realized in close cooperation with domain experts in order to account for the domain's peculiarities, and to address its very specific needs. We propose the final annotation schema for annotation of texts in the archaeological domain. Further work will focus on the annotation of a larger amount of articles, and on the development of domain specific tools. Acknowledgments",
