We obtain a best cross validation F-measure of 65.8 using gold dialog act features and 55.6 without using them. Introduction Analyzing written dialogs (such as email exchanges) to extract social power relations has generated great interest recently. This paper introduces a new task within the general field of finding power relations in written dialogs. In written dialog, an utterance can represent an overt display of power (ODP) on the part of the utterer if it constrains the addressee's actions beyond the constraints that the underlying dialog act on its own imposes. For example, a request for action is the first part of an adjacency pair and thus requires a response from the addressee, but declining the request is a valid response. However, the utterer may formulate her request for action in a way that attempts to remove the option of declining it (\"Come to my office now!\"). In so doing, she restricts her addressee's options for responding more severely than a simple request for action would. Our new task is to classify utterances in written dialog as to whether they are ODPs or not. Such a classification can be interesting in and of itself, and it can also be used to study social relations among dialog participants. After reviewing related work (Section 2), we define \"overt display of power\" (Section 3) and then present manual annotations for ODP in a small subset of Enron email corpus. In Section 5, we present a supervised learning system using word and part-ofspeech features along with features indicating dialog acts. Related Work Many studies in sociolinguistics have shown that power relations are manifested in language use (e.g., (O'Barr, 1982) ). Locher (2004) recognizes \"restriction of an interactant's action-environment\" (Wartenberg, 1990 ) as a key element by which exercise of power in interactions can be identified. Through ODP we capture this action-restriction at an utterance level. In the computational field, several studies have used Social Network Analysis (e.g., (Diesner and Carley, 2005) ) for extracting social relations from online communication. Only recently have researchers started using NLP to analyze the content of messages to deduce social relations (e.g., (Diehl et al., 2007) ). Bramsen et al. (2011) use knowledge of the actual organizational structure to create two sets of messages: messages sent from a superior to a subordinate, and vice versa. Their task is to determine the direction of power (since all their data, by construction of the corpus, has a power relationship). Their reported results cannot be directly compared with ours since their results are on classifying aggregations of messages as being to a superior or to a subordinate, whereas our results are on predicting whether a single utterance has an ODP or not. Overt Display of Power (ODP) Dialog is successful when all discourse participants show cooperative dialog behavior. Certain types of dialog acts, notably requests for actions and requests for information (questions), \"set constraints on what should be done in a next turn\" (Sacks et al., 1974) . Suppose a boss sends an email to her subordinate: \"It would be great if you could come to my office right now\". He responds by politely declining (\"Would love to, but unfortunately I need to pick up my kids\"). He has met the expectation to respond in one of the constrained ways that the request for action allows (other acceptable responses include a commitment to performing the action, or actually performing the action, while unacceptable responses include silence, or changing the topic). However, dialog acts only provide an initial description of these constraints. Other sources of constraints include the social relations between the utterer and the addressee, and the linguistic form of the utterance. Assume our email example had come, say, from the CEO of the company. In this case, the addressee's response would not meet the constraints set by the utterance, even though it is still analyzed as the same dialog act (a request for action). Detecting such power relations and determining their effect on dialog is a hard problem, and it is the ultimate goal of our research. Therefore, we do not use knowledge of power relations as features in performing a finergrained analysis of dialog acts. Instead, we turn to the linguistic form of an utterance. Specifically, the utterer can choose linguistic forms in her utterance to signal that she is imposing further constraints on the addressee's choice of how to respond, constraints which go beyond those defined by the standard set of dialog acts. For example, if the boss's email is \"Please come to my office right now\", and the addressee declines, he is clearly not adhering to the constraints the boss has signaled, though he is adhering to the general constraints of cooperative dialog by responding to the request for action. We are interested in these additional constraints imposed on utterances through choices in linguistic form. We define an utterance to have Overt Display of Power (ODP) if it is interpreted as creating additional constraints on the response beyond those imposed by the general dialog act. Note that use of polite lan- guage does not, on its own, determine the presence or absence of an ODP. Furthermore, the presence of an ODP does not presuppose that the utterer actually possess social power: the utterer could be attempting to gain power. Table 1 presents some sample utterances chosen from our corpus (the * indicates those without ODP). An utterance with ODP can be an explicit order or command (s3, s8) or an implicit one (s2, s5). It can be a simple sentence (s3) or a complex one (s1). It can be an imperative (s3), an interrogative (s5) or even a declarative (s2) sentence. But not all imperatives (s4) or interrogatives (s6, s7) are ODPs. s5, s6 and s7 are all syntactically questions. However, s5's discourse function within an email is to request/order to work on \"that\" which makes it an instance of ODP, while s6 is merely an inquiry and s7 is a rhetorical question. This makes the problem of finding ODP in utterances a non-trivial one. Data and Annotations For our study, we use a small corpus of Enron email threads which has been previously annotated with dialog acts (Hu et al., 2009) . The corpus contains 122 email threads with 360 messages, 1734 utterances and 20,740 word tokens. We trained an annotator using the definition for ODP given in Section 3. She was given full email threads whose messages were already segmented into utterances. She identified 86 utterances (about 5%) to have an ODP. 1 In 1 These annotations were done as part of a larger annotation effort (Prabhakaran et al., 2012) . The annotated corpus can be obtained at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/\u223cvinod/powerann/. order to validate the annotations, we trained another annotator using the same definitions and examples and had him annotate 46 randomly selected threads from the corpus, which contained a total of 595 utterances (34.3% of whole corpus). We obtained a reasonable inter annotator agreement, \u03ba value, of 0.669, which validates the annotations while confirming that the task is not a trivial one. Automatic ODP Tagging In this section, we present a supervised learning method to tag unseen utterances that contain an ODP using a binary SVM classifier. We use the tokenizer, POS tagger, lemmatizer and SVMLight (Joachims, 1999) wrapper that come with ClearTK (Ogren et al., 2008) . We use a linear kernel with C = 1 for all experiments and present (P)recision, (R)ecall and (F)-measure obtained on 5-fold cross validation on the data. Our folds do not cross thread boundaries. Handling Class Imbalance In its basic formulation, SVMs learn a decision function f from a set of positive and negative training instances such that an unlabeled instance x is labeled as positive if f (x) > 0. Since SVMs optimize on training set accuracy to learn f , it performs better on balanced training sets. However, our dataset is highly imbalanced (\u223c 5% positive instances). We explore two ways of handling this class imbalance problem: an instance weighting method, InstWeight, where training errors on negative instances are outweighed by errors on positive instances, and SigThresh, a threshold adjusting method to find a better threshold for f (x). For InstWeight, we used the j option in SVMlight to set the outweighing factor to be the ratio of negative to positive instances in the training set for each cross validation fold. Inst-Weight is roughly equivalent to oversampling by repeating positive instances. For SigThresh, we used a threshold based on a posterior probabilistic score, p = P r(y = 1|x), calculated using the ClearTK implementation of Lin et al. ( 2007 )'s algorithm. It uses Platt (1999) 's approximation of p to a sigmoid function P A,B (f ) = (1 + exp(Af + B)) \u22121 , where A and B are estimated from the training set. Then, we predict x as positive if p > 0.5 which in effect shifts the threshold for f (x) to a value based on its distri- We also used a feature (FV) to denote the first verb lemma in the utterance. Since ODPs, like dialog acts, constrain how the addressee should react, we also include Dialog Acts as features (DA). We use the manual gold dialog act annotations present in our corpus, which use a very small dialog act tag set. An utterance has one of 5 dialog acts: Reques-tAction, RequestInformation, Inform, Commit and Conventional (see (Hu et al., 2009) for details). For example, for utterance s2, FV would be 'need' and DA would be 'Inform'. 3 Results and Analysis We present two simple baselines -ALL-TRUE, where an utterance is always predicted to have an ODP, and RANDOM, where an utterance is predicted at random, with 50% chance to have an ODP. We also present a strong baseline WORD-UNG, which is trained using surface-form word unigrams as features. ALL-TRUE and RANDOM obtained F scores of 9.5 and 10.4 respectively, while WORD-UNG obtained an F score of 34.7 under InstWeight, and improved it to 48.6 under SigThresh. For LN, PN and MN, we first found the best value for n to be 1, 2 and 4, respectively. We then did an exhaustive search in all combinations of LN, PN, MN, FV and DA under both InstWeight and SigThresh. Results obtained for best feature subset under both configurations are presented in Table 2 in rows 3 and 4. SigThresh outweighed InstWeight in all our experiments. (Combining these two techniques for dealing with class imbalance performed worse than using either one.) In both settings, we surpassed the WORD-UNG baseline by a high margin. We found MN and DA to be most useful: removing either from the feature set dropped the F significantly in both settings. We obtained a best F score of 65.8 using PN, MN and DA under the SigThresh. Following (Guyon et al., 2002) , we inspected feature weights of the model created for the last fold of our best performing feature configuration as a posthoc analysis. The binary feature DA:RequestAction got the highest positive weight of 2.5. The top ten positive weighted features included patterns like you VB, * VB, MD PRP, VB VB and * MD, where * denotes the utterance boundary. DA:Inform got the most negative weight of -1.4, followed by DA:Conventional with -1.0. The top ten negative weighted features included patterns like MD VB, VB you, what, VB VB me VB and WP. In both cases, DA features got almost 2.5 times higher weight than the highest weighted ngram pattern, which reaffirms their importance in this task. Also, mixed ngrams helped to capture long patterns like \"please let me know\" by VB VB me VB without increasing dimensionality as much as word ngrams; they also distinguish VB you with a negative weight of -0.51 from VB me with a positive weight of 0.32, which pure POS ngrams couldn't have captured. Not Using Gold Dialog Acts We also evaluate the performance of our ODP tagger without using gold DA tags. We instead use the DA tagger of Hu et al. (2009) , which we re-trained using the training sets for each of our cross validation folds, applying it to the test set of that fold. We then did cross validation for the ODP tagger using gold dialog acts for training and automatically tagged dialog acts for testing. However, for our best performing feature set so far, this reduced the F score from 65.8 to 52.7. Our best result for ODP tagging without using gold DAs is shown in row 5 in Table 2 , 56.9 F score under SigThresh. The features used are all of our features other than the DA tags. On further analysis, we find that even though the dialog act tagger has a high accuracy (85.8% in our cross validation), it obtained a very low recall of 28.6% and precision of 47.6% for the RequestAction dialog act. Since RequestAction is the most important feature (weighted 1.7 times more than the next feature), the DA-tagger's poor performance on Reques-tAction hurt ODP tagging badly. The performance reduction in this setting is probably partly due to using gold DAs in training and automatically tagged DAs in testing; however, we feel that improving the detection of minority classes in dialog act tagging (RequestAction constitutes only 2.5% in the corpus) is a necessary first step towards successfully using automatically tagged DAs in ODP tagging. Conclusion We have introduced a new binary classification task on utterances in dialogs, namely predicting Overt Display of Power. An ODP adds constraints on the possible responses by the addressee. We have introduced a corpus annotated for ODP and we have shown that using supervised machine learning with gold dialog acts we can achieve an F-measure of 66% despite the fact that ODPs are very rare in the corpus. We intend to develop a better dialog act tagger which we can use to automatically obtain dialog act labels for ODP classification.
