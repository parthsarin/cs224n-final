We train a classifier for identifying those synonymous relations by using spelling variations as main clues. We compared two approaches: the direct identification of bilingual synonym pairs, and the merger of two monolingual synonyms. We showed that our approach achieves a high pair-wise precision and recall, and outperforms the baseline method. Introduction Automatically collecting synonyms from language resources is an ongoing task for natural language processing (NLP). Most NLP systems have difficulties in dealing with synonyms, which are different representations that have the same meaning in a language. Information retrieval (IR) could leverage synonyms to improve the coverage of search results (Qiu and Frei, 1993) . For example, when we input the query 'transportation in India' into an IR system, the system can expand the query to its synonyms; e.g. 'transport' and 'railway', to find more documents. This paper proposes a method for the automatic identification of bilingual synonyms in a bilingual lexicon, with spelling variation clues. A bilingual synonym set is a set of translation-equivalent term pairs sharing the same meaning. Although a number of studies have aimed at identifying synonyms, this is the first study that simultaneously finds synonyms in two languages, to our best knowledge. Let us consider the case where a user enters the Japanese query 'k\u014dj\u014d' (\u5de5\u5834, industrial plant) into a cross-lingual IR system to find English documents. After translating the query into the English translation equivalent, 'plant,' the cross-lingual IR system may expand the query to its English synonyms, e.g. 'factory,' and 'workshop,' and retrieve documents that include the expanded terms. However, the term 'plant' is ambiguous; the system may also expand the query to 'vegetable,' and the system is prevented by the term which is different from our intention. In contrast, the system can easily reject the latter expansion, 'vegetable,' if we are aware of bilingual synonyms, which indicate synonymous relations over bilingual lexicons: (k\u014dj\u014d, plant) \u223c (k\u014dj\u014d, factory) and (shokubutsu 1 , plant) \u223c (shokubutsu, vegetable) 2 (See Figure 1 ). The expression of the translation equivalent, (k\u014dj\u014d, plant), helps a crosslingual IR system to retrieve documents that include the term 'plant,' used in the meaning for k\u014dj\u014d, or industrial plants. We present a supervised machine learning approach for identifying bilingual synonyms. Designing features for bilingual synonyms such as spelling variations and bilingual associations, we train a classifier with a manually annotated bilingual lexicon with synonymous information. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we carried out experiments to identify bilingual synonyms by two approaches: the direct identification of bilingual synonym pairs, and bilingual synonym pairs merged from two monolingual synonym lists. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the F-scores Figure 1 : An example of an ambiguous term 'plant', and the synonyms and translation equivalents (TE) 89.3% in the former approach and 91.4% in the latter, thus outperforming the baseline method that employs only bilingual relations as its clues. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes related work on synonym extraction and spelling variations. Section 3 describes the overview and definition of bilingual synonyms, the proposed method and employed features. In Section 4 we evaluate our method and conclude this paper. Related work There have been many approaches for detecting synonyms and constructing thesauri. Two main resources for synonym extraction are large text corpora and dictionaries. Many studies extract synonyms from large monolingual corpora by using context information around target terms (Croach and Yang, 1992; Park and Choi, 1996; Waterman, 1996; Curran, 2004) . Some researchers (Hindle, 1990; Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998) classify terms by similarities based on their distributional syntactic patterns. These methods often extract not only synonyms, but also semantically related terms, such as antonyms, hyponyms and coordinate terms such as 'cat' and 'dog.' Some studies make use of bilingual corpora or dictionaries to find synonyms in a target language (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002; Wu and Zhou, 2003; Lin et al., 2003) . Lin et al. (2003) chose a set of synonym candidates for a term by using a bilingual dictionary and computing distributional similarities in the candidate set to extract synonyms. They adopt the bilingual information to exclude non-synonyms (e.g., antonyms and hyponyms) that may be used in the similar contexts. Although they make use of bilingual dictionaries, this study aims at finding bilingual synonyms directly. In the approaches based on monolingual dictionaries, the similarities of definitions of lexical items are important clues for identifying synonyms (Blondel et al., 2004; Muller et al., 2006) . For instance, Blondel et al. ( 2004 ) constructed an associated dictionary graph whose vertices are the terms, and whose edges from v 1 to v 2 represent occurrence of v 2 in the definition for v 1 . They choose synonyms from the graph by collecting terms pointed to and from the same terms. Another strategy for finding synonyms is to consider the terms themselves. We divide it into two approaches: rule-based and distance-based. Rule-based approaches implement rules with language-specific patterns and detect variations by applying rules to terms. Stemming (Lovins, 1968; Porter, 1980) is one of the rule-based approaches, which cuts morphological suffix inflections, and obtains the stems of words. There are other types of variations for phrases; for example, insertion, deletion or substitution of words, and permutation of words such as 'view point' and 'point of view' are such variations (Daille et al., 1996) . Distance-based approaches model the similarity or dissimilarity measure between two terms to find similar terms. The edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966) is the most widely-used measure, based on the minimum number of operations of insertion, deletion, or substitution of characters for transforming one term into another. It can be efficiently calculated by using 1 a dynamic programming algorithm, and we can set the costs/weights for each character type. Bilingual Synonyms and Translation Equivalents This section describes the notion of bilingual synonyms and our method for identifying the synonymous pairs of translation equivalents. We consider a bilingual synonym as a set of translation-equivalent term pairs referring to the same concept. Tables 1 and 2 are an example of bilingual synonym sets. There are ten Japanese-English translation-equivalent term pairs and five bilingual synonym sets in this example. A Japanese term 'raito' is the phonetic transcription of both 'light' and 'right,' and it covers four concepts described by the three English terms. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship among these terms. The synonymous relation and the translation equivalence are considered to be similar in that two terms share the meanings. Following synonymous relation between terms in one language, we deal with the synonymous relation between bilingual translation-equivalent term pairs 2 Solid lines show that two terms are translation equivalents, while dotted lines show that two terms are (monolingual) synonyms. as bilingual synonyms. The advantage of managing the lexicon in the format of bilingual synonyms is that we can facilitate to tie the concepts and the terms. Definitions Let E and F be monolingual lexicons. We first assume that a term e \u2208 E (or f \u2208 F ) refers to one or more concepts, and define that a term e is a synonym 3 of e (\u2208 E) if and only if e and e share an identical concept 4 . Let '\u223c' represent the synonymous relation, and this relation is not transitive because a term often has several concepts: e \u223c e \u2227 e \u223c e =\u21d2 e \u223c e . (1) We define a synonym set (synset) E c as a set whose elements share an identical concept c: E c = {e \u2208 E|\u2200e refers to c}. For a term set E c (\u2286 E), E c is a synonym set (synset) =\u21d2 \u2200e, e \u2208 E c e \u223c e (2) is true, but the converse is not necessarily true, because of the ambiguity of terms. Note that one term can belong to multiple synonym sets from the definition. Let D(\u2286 F \u00d7 E) be a bilingual lexicon defined as a set of term pairs (f, e) (f \u2208 F, e \u2208 E) satisfying that f and e refer to an identical concept. We call these pairs translation equivalents, which refer to concepts that both f and e refer to. We define that two bilingual lexical items p and p (\u2208 D) are bilingual synonyms if and only if p and p refer to an identical concept in common with the definition of (monolingual) synonyms. This relation is not transitive again, and if e \u223c e and f \u223c f , it is not necessarily true that p \u223c p : e \u223c e \u2227 f \u223c f =\u21d2 p \u223c p (3) because of the ambiguity of terms. Similarly, we can define a bilingual synonym set (synset) D c as a set whose elements share an identical meaning c: D c = {p \u2208 D|\u2200p refers to c}. For a set of transla- tion eqiuvalents D c , D c is a bilingual synonym set (synset) =\u21d2 \u2200p, p \u2208 D c p \u223c p (4) is true, but the converse is not necessarily true. Identifying bilingual synonym pairs In this section, we describe an algorithm to identify bilingual synonym pairs by using spelling variation clues. After identifying the pairs, we can construct bilingual synonym sets by assuming that the converse of the condition (4) is true, and finding sets of bilingual lexical items in which all paired items are bilingual synonyms. We can see this method as the complete-linkage clustering of translationequivalent term pairs. We can adopt another option to construct them by assuming also that the bilingual synonymous relation has transitivity: p \u223c p \u2227 p \u223c p =\u21d2 p \u223c p , and this can be seen as simplelinkage clustering. This simplified method ignores the ambiguity of terms, and it may construct a bilingual synonym sets which includes many senses. In spite of the risk, it is effective to find large synonym sets in case the bilingual synonym pairs are not sufficiently detected. In this paper we focus only on identifying bilingual synonym pairs and evaluating the performance of the identification. We employ a supervised machine learning technique with features related to spelling variations and so on. Figure 3 shows the framework for this method. At first we prepare a bilingual lexicon with synonymous information as training data, and generate a list consisting of all bilingual lexical item Figure 3 : Overview of our framework pairs in the bilingual lexicon. The presence or absence of bilingual synonymous relations is attached to each element of the list. Then, we build a classifier learned by training data, using a maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996) and the features related to spelling variations in Table 3 . We apply some preprocessings for extracting some features. For English, we transform all terms into lower-case, and do not apply any other transformations such as tokenization by symbols. For Japanese, we apply a morphological analyzer JU-MAN (Kurohashi et al., 1994) and obtain hiragana representations 5 as much as possible 6 . We may require other language-specific preprocessings for applying this method to other languages. We employed binary or real-valued features described in Table 3 . Moreover, we introduce the following combinatorial features: h 1F \u2227 h 1E , \u221a h 2F \u2022 h 2E , \u221a h 3F \u2022 h 3E , h 5E \u2227 h 5F , h 6 \u2022 h 2F and h 7 \u2022 h 2E . Two approaches for identifying bilingual synonym pairs There are two approaches for identifying bilingual synonym pairs: one is directly identifying whether two bilingual lexical items are bilingual synonyms ('bilingual' method), and another is first The count that sub-sequences of the target terms match as known terms or are in known synonymous relation h 5F , h 5E : Existence of crossing bilingual lexical items For bilingual lexical items (f1, e1) and (f2, e2), whether (f1, e2) (for h5F ) or (f2, e1) (for h5E) is in the bilingual lexicon of the training set h 6 : Acronyms Whether one English term is an acronym for another (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003) h 7 : Katakana variants Whether one Japanese term is a katakana variant for another (Masuyama et al., 2004) Table 3 : Features used for identifying bilingual synonym pairs h iF is the feature value when the terms w and w (\u2208 F ) are compared in the i-th feature and so as h iE . h 6 is only for English and h 7 is only for Japanese. identifying monolingual synonyms in each language and then merging them according to the bilingual items ('monolingual' method). We implement these two approaches and compare the results. For identifying monolingual synonyms, we use features with bilingual items as follows: For a term pair e 1 and e 2 , we obtain all the translation candidates h 1F , F 1 = {f |(f, e 1 ) \u2208 D} and F 2 = {f |(f , e 2 ) \u2208 D}, and calculate feature values related to F 1 and/or F 2 by obtaining the maximum feature value using F 1 and/or F 2 . After that, if all the following four conditions (p 1 = (f 1 , e 1 ) \u2208 D, p 2 = (f 2 , e 2 ) \u2208 D, f 1 \u223c e 1 and f 2 \u223c e 2 ) are satisfied, we assume that p 1 and p 2 are bilingual synonym pairs 7 . Experiment Experimental settings We performed experiments to identify bilingual synonym pairs by using the Japanese-English lexicon with synonymous information 8 . The lexicon consists of translation-equivalent term pairs extracted from titles and abstracts of scientific papers published in Japan. It contains many spelling variations and synonyms for constructing and maintaining the thesaurus of scientific terms and improving the coverage. Table 4 illustrates this lexicon. Table 5 shows the statistics of the dictionary. We used information only synonym IDs and Japanese and English representations. We extract pairs of bilingual lexical items, and treat them as events for training of the maximum entropy method. The parameters were adjusted so that the performance is the best for the development set. For a monolingual method, we used T b = 0.8, and for a bilingual method, we used T b = 0.7. Evaluation We evaluated the performance of identifying bilingual synonym pairs by the pair-wise precision \u76f4\u8178\u5b50\u5bae\u304b (chokuch\u014d-shiky\u016b-ka) rectouterine pouch Table 4 : A part of the lexicon used Each bilingual synonym set consists of items that have the same synset ID. \u90e8\u5206 (bubun) is a synonym of \u90e8\u4f4d (bui). \u304b (ka) is a hiragana representation of \u7aa9 (ka). \u30c0\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9 (Dagurasu) is a Japanese transcription of 'Douglas'. recall R and F-score F defined as follows: P = C T , R = C N , F = 2P R P + R , ( 5 ) where C, T and N are the number of correctly predicted pairs as synonyms, predicted pairs to become synonyms, and synonym pairs in the lexicon 9 , respectively. We compared the results with the baseline and the upper bound. The baseline assumes that each bilingual lexical item is a bilingual synonym if either the Japanese or English terms are identical. The upper bound assumes that all the monolingual synonyms are known and each bilingual item is a bilingual synonym if the Japanese terms and the English terms are synonymous. The baseline represents the performance when we do not consider spelling variations, and the upper bound shows the limitation of the monolingual approach. Result Table 6 shows the evaluation scores of our experiments. The 'monolingual' and 'bilingual' methods are described in Section 3.2.1. We obtained high precision and recall scores, although we used features primarily with spelling variations. Both methods significantly outperform the baseline, and show the importance of considering spelling variations. many kinds of lexicons. To investigate the effectiveness of each feature, we compared the scores when we remove several features. Table 7 shows these results. Contrary to our intuition, we found that features of agreement of the first characters (h 1 ) remarkably degraded the recall without gains in precision. One of the reasons for such results is that there are many cases of non-synonyms that have the same first character. We need to investigate more effective combinations of features or to apply other machine learning techniques for improving the performance. From these results, we consider that the features of h 4 are effective for improving the recall, and that the features of h 2 and h 5 contribute improvement of both the precision and the recall. h 3 , h 6 , h 7 , and combinatorial features seem to improve the recall at the expense of precision. Which measure is important depends on the importance of our target for using this technique. It depends on the requirements that we emphasize, but in general the recall is more important for finding more bilingual synonyms. Conclusion and future work This paper proposed a method for identifying bilingual synonyms in a bilingual lexicon by using clues of spelling variations. We described the notion of bilingual synonyms, and presented two approaches for identifying them: one is to directly predict the relation, and another is to merge monolingual synonyms identified, according to the bilingual lexicon. Our experiments showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed the method that did not use features primarily with spelling variations; the proposed method extracted bilingual synonyms with high precision and recall. In addition, we found that merging monolingual synonyms by the dictionary is effective for finding bilingual synonyms; there occur few errors through the assumption described in Section 3.2.1. Our future work contains implementing more features for identifying synonymous relations, constructing bilingual synonym sets, and evaluating our method for specific tasks such as thesaurus construction or cross-lingual information retrieval. Currently, the features used do not include other clues with spelling variations, such as the weighted edit distance, transformation patterns, stemming and so on. Another important clue is distributional information, such as the context. We can use both monolingual and bilingual corpora for extracting distributions of terms, and bilingual corpora are expected to be especially effective for our goal. We did not perform an experiment to construct bilingual synonym sets from synonym pairs in this paper. Described in Section 3.1, bilingual synonym sets can be constructed from bilingual synonym pairs by assuming some approximations. The approximation that permits transitivity of bilingual synonymous relations increases identified bilingual synonyms, and thus causes an increase in recall and decrease in precision. It is an open problem to find appropriate strategies for constructing bilingual synonym sets. Finally, we plan to evaluate our method for specific tasks. For data-driven machine translation, it is expected that data sparseness problem is alleviated by merging the occurrences of low-frequency terms. Another application is cross-lingual information retrieval, which can be improved by using candidate expanded queries from bilingual synonym sets.
