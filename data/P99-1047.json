The algorithm exploits robust lexical, syntactic, and semantic knowledge sources. I Introduction The application of decision-based learning techniques over rich sets of linguistic features has improved significantly the coverage and performance of syntactic (and to various degrees semantic) parsers (Simmons and Yu, 1992; Magerman, 1995; Hermjakob and Mooney, 1997) . In this paper, we apply a similar paradigm to developing a rhetorical parser that derives the discourse structure of unrestricted texts. Crucial to our approach is the reliance on a corpus of 90 texts which were manually annotated with discourse trees and the adoption of a shift-reduce parsing model that is well-suited for learning. Both the corpus and the parsing model are used to generate learning cases of how texts should be partitioned into elementary discourse units and how discourse units and segments should be assembled into discourse trees. The Corpus We used a corpus of 90 rhetorical structure trees, which were built manually using rhetorical relations that were defined informally in the style of Mann and Thompson (1988) : 30 trees were built for short personal news stories from the MUC7 coreference corpus (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997) ; 30 trees for scientific texts from the Brown corpus; and 30 trees for editorials from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The average number of words for each text was 405 in the MUC corpus, 2029 in the Brown corpus, and 878 in the WSJ corpus. Each MUC text was tagged by three annotators; each Brown and WSJ text was tagged by two annotators. The rhetorical structure assigned to each text is a (possibly non-binary) tree whose leaves correspond to elementary discourse units (edu)s, and whose internal nodes correspond to contiguous text spans. Each internal node is characterized by a rhetorical relation, such as ELABORATION and CONTRAST. Each relation holds between two non-overlapping text spans called NUCLEUS and SATELLITE. (There are a few exceptions to this rule: some relations, such as SEQUENCE and CONTRAST, are multinuclear.) The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's purpose than the satellite. Each node in the tree is also characterized by a promotion set that denotes the units that are important in the corresponding subtree. The promotion sets of leaf nodes are the leaves themselves. The promotion sets of internal nodes are given by the union of the promotion sets of the immediate nuclei nodes. Edus are defined functionally as clauses or clause-like units that are unequivocally the NU-CLEUS or SATELLITE of a rhetorical relation that holds between two adjacent spans of text. For example, \"because of the low atmospheric pressure\" in text (1) is not a fully fleshed clause. However, since it is the SATELLITE of an EXPLANATION relation, we treat it as elementary. [Only the midday sun at tropical latitudes is warm enough] [to thaw ice on occasion,] [but any liquid water formed in this way would evaporate almost instantly] [because of the low atmospheric pressure.] (1) Some edus may contain parenthetical units, i.e., embedded units whose deletion does not affect the understanding of the edu to which they belong. For example, the unit shown in italics in (2) is paren-thetic. This book, which I have received from John, is the best (2) book that I have read in a while. The annotation process was carried out using a rhetorical tagging tool. The process consisted in assigning edu and parenthetical unit boundaries, in assembling edus and spans into discourse trees, and in labeling the relations between edus and spans with rhetorical relation names from a taxonomy of 71 relations. No explicit distinction was made between intentional, informational, and textual relations. In addition, we also marked two constituency relations that were ubiquitous in our corpora and that often subsumed complex rhetorical constituents. These relations were ATTRIBUTION, which was used to label the relation between a reporting and a reported clause, and APPOSITION. Marcu et al. (1999) discuss in detail the annotation tool and protocol and assess the inter-judge agreement and the reliability of the annotation. The parsing model We model the discourse parsing process as a sequence of shift-reduce operations. As front-end, the parser uses a discourse segmenter, i.e., an algorithm that partitions the input text into edus. The discourse segmenter, which is also decision-based, is presented and evaluated in section 4. The input to the parser is an empty stack and an input list that contains a sequence of elementary discourse trees, edts, one edt for each edu produced by the discourse segmenter. The status and rhetorical relation associated with each edt is UNDEFINED, and the promotion set is given by the corresponding edu. At each step, the parser applies a SHIFT or a REDUCE operation. Shift operations transfer the first edt of the input list to the top of the stack. Reduce operations pop the two discourse trees located on the top of the stack; combine them into a new tree updating the statuses, rhetorical relation names, and promotion sets associated with the trees involved in the operation; and push the new tree on the top of the stack. Assume, for example, that the discourse segmenter partitions a text given as input as shown in (3). (Only the edus numbered from 12 to 19 are shown.) Figure 1 shows the actions taken by a shiftreduce discourse parser starting with step i. At step i, the stack contains 4 partial discourse trees, which span units [1, 11] , [12, 15] , [16, 17] , and [18] , and the input list contains the edts that correspond to units whose numbers are higher than or equal to 19. At step i the parser decides to perform a SHIFT operation. As a result, the edt corresponding to unit 19 becomes the top of the stack. At step i + 1, the parser performs a REDUCE-APPOSITION-NS operation, that combines edts 18 and 19 into a discourse tree whose nucleus is unit 18 and whose satellite is unit 19. The rhetorical relation that holds between units 18 and 19 is APPOSITION. At step i+2, the trees that span over units [16, 17] and [18, 19] are combined into a larger tree, using a REDUCE-ATTRIBUTION-NS operation. As a result, the status of the tree [16, 17] becomes NUCLEUS and the status of the tree [18, 19] becomes SATELLITE. The rhetorical relation between the two trees is ATTRIBUTION. At step i + 3, the trees at the top of the stack are combined using a REDUCE-ELABORATION-NS operation. The effect of the operation is shown at the bottom of figure 1 . In order to enable a shift-reduce discourse parser derive any discourse tree, it is sufficient to implement one SHIFT operation and six types of REDUCE operations, whose operational semantics is shown in figure 2 trees involved in the reduce operations are affected in each case. Since the labeled data that we relied upon was sparse, we grouped the relations that shared some rhetorical meaning into clusters of rhetorical similarity. For example, the cluster named CONTRAST contained the contrast-like rhetorical relations of ANTITHESIS, CONTRAST, and CON-CESSION. The  In the work described in this paper, we attempted to automatically derive rhetorical structures trees that were labeled with relations names that corresponded to the 17 clusters of rhetorical similarity. Since there are 6 types of reduce operations and since each discourse tree in our study uses relation names that correspond to the 17 clusters of rhetorical similarity, it follows that our discourse parser needs to learn what operation to choose from a set of 6 \u00d7 17 + 1 = 103 operations (the 1 corresponds to the SHXFT operation). 4 The discourse segmenter Generation of learning examples The discourse segmenter we implemented processes an input text one lexeme (word or punctuation mark) at a time and recognizes sentence and edu boundaries and beginnings and ends of parenthetical units. We used the leaves of the discourse trees that were built manually in order to derive the learning cases. To each lexeme in a text, we associated one learning case, using the features described in section 4.2. The classes to be learned, which are associated with each lexeme, are sentence-break, edubreak, start-paTen, end-paTen, and none. Features used for learning To partition a text into edus and to detect parenthetical unit boundaries, we relied on features that model both the local and global contexts. The local context consists of a window of size 5 that enumerates the Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags of the lexeme under scrutiny and the two lexemes found immediately before and after it. The POS tags are determined automatically, using the Brill tagger (1995). Since discourse markers, such as because and and, have been shown to play a major role in rhetorical parsing (Marcu, 1997) , we also consider a list of features that specify whether a lexeme found within the local contextual window is a potential discourse marker. The local context also contains features that estimate whether the lexemes within the window are potential abbreviations. The global context reflects features that pertain to the boundary identification process. These features specify whether a discourse marker that introduces expectations (Cristea and Webber, 1997 ) (such as although) was used in the sentence under consideration, whether there are any commas or dashes before the estimated end of the sentence, and whether there are any verbs in the unit under consideration. A binary representation of the features that characterize both the local and global contexts yields learning examples with 2417 features/example. Evaluation We used the C4.5 program (Quinlan, 1993) edu boundaries. The performance is high with respect to recognizing sentence boundaries and ends of parenthetical units. The performance with respect to identifying sentence boundaries appears to be close to that of systems aimed at identifying only sentence boundaries (Palmer and Hearst, 1997) , whose accuracy is in the range of 99%. Figure 3 : Learning curve for discourse segmenter (the MUC corpus). emes as boundaries of sentences, edus, or parenthetical units, or as non-boundaries. We learned both from binary (when we could) and non-binary representations of the cases. 1 In general the binary representations yielded slightly better results than the non-binary representations and the tree classifiers were slightly better than the rule-based ones. Due to space constraints, we show here (in table 1 ) only accuracy results that concern non-binary, decisiontree classifiers. The accuracy figures were computed using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure. In table 1, B1 corresponds to a majority-based baseline classifier that assigns none to all lexemes, and B2 to a baseline classifier that assigns a sentence boundary to every DOT lexeme and a non-boundary to all other lexemes. Figure 3 shows the learning curve that corresponds to the MUC corpus. It suggests that more data can increase the accuracy of the classifier. The confusion matrix shown in table 2 corresponds to a non-binary-based tree classifier that was trained on cases derived from 27 Brown texts and that was tested on cases derived from 3 different Brown texts, which were selected randomly. The matrix shows that the segmenter has problems mostly with identifying the beginning of parenthetical units and the intra-sentential edu boundaries; for example, it correctly identifies only 133 of the 220 ZLeaming from binary representations of features in the Brown corpus was too computationally expensive to terminate --the Brown data file had about 0.5GBytes. The shift-reduce action identifier , Generation of learning examples The learning cases were generated automatically, in the style of Magerman (1995) , by traversing inorder the final rhetorical structures built by annotators and by generating a sequence of discourse parse actions that used only SHIFT and REDUCE operations of the kinds discussed in section 3. When a derived sequence is applied as described in the parsing model, it produces a rhetorical tree that is a one-to-one copy of the original tree that was used to generate the sequence. For example, the tree at the bottom of figure 1 --the tree found at the top of the stack at step i + 4 --can be built if the following sequence of operations is performed: {SHIFT 12; SHIFT 13; REDUCE-ATTRIBUTION-NS; SHIFT 14; Features used for learning To make decisions with respect to parsing actions, the shift-reduce action identifier focuses on the three top most trees in the stack and the first edt in the input list. We refer to these trees as the trees in focus. The identifier relies on the following classes of features. Structural features. \u2022 Features that reflect the number of trees in the stack and the number of edts in the input list. \u2022 Features that describe the structure of the trees in focus in terms of the type of textual units that they subsume (sentences, paragraphs, titles); the number of immediate children of the root nodes; the rhetorical relations that link the immediate children of the root nodes, etc. 2 Lexical (cue-phrase-like) and syntactic features. \u2022 Features that denote the actual words and POS tags of the first and last two lexemes of the text spans subsumed by the trees in focus. \u2022 Features that denote whether the first and last units of the trees in focus contain potential discourse markers and the position of these markers in the corresponding textual units (beginning, middle, or end). Operational features. \u2022 Features that specify what the last five parsing operations performed by the parser were. 3 Semantic-similarity-based features. \u2022 Features that denote the semantic similarity between the textual segments subsumed by the trees in focus. This similarity is computed by applying in the style of Hearst (1997) a cosine-based metric on the morphed segments. \u2022 Features that denote Wordnet-based measures of similarity between the bags of words in the promotion sets of the trees in focus. We use 14 Wordnetbased measures of similarity, one for each Wordnet relation (Fellbaum, 1998) . Each of these similarities is computed using a metric similar to the cosine-based metric. Wordnet-based similarities reflect the degree of synonymy, antonymy, meronymy, hyponymy, etc. between the textual segments subsumed by the trees in focus. We also use 14 x 13/2 relative Wordnet-based measures of similarity, one for each possible pair of Wordnet-based relations. For each pair of Wordnet-based measures of similarity w~l and wr2, each relative measure (feature) takes the value <, =, or >, depending on whether the Wordnet-based similarity w~l between the bags of words in the promotion sets of the trees in focus is lower, equal, or higher that the Wordnet-based similarity w~2 between the same bags of words. For example, if both the synonymy-and meronymy-based measures of similarity are 0, the relative similarity between the synonymy and meronymy of the trees in focus will have the value =. 2The identifier assumes that each sentence break that ends in a period and is followed by two '\\n' characters, for example, is a paragraph break; and that a sentence break that does not end in a punctuation mark and is followed by two '\\n' characters is a title. 3We could generate these features because, for learning, we used sequences of shift-reduce operations and not discourse trees.  A binary representation of these features yields learning examples with 2789 features/example. Evaluation The shift-reduce action identifier uses the C4.5 program in order to learn decision trees and rules that specify how discourse segments should be assembled into trees. In general, the tree-based classifiers performed slightly better than the rule-based classitiers. Due to space constraints, we present here only performance results that concern the tree classifiers. Table 3 displays the accuracy of the shift-reduce action identifiers, determined for each of the three corpora by means of a ten-fold cross-validation procedure. In table 3, the B3 column gives the accuracy of a majority-based classifier, which chooses action SHIFT in all cases. Since choosing only the action SHIFT never produces a discourse tree, in column B4, we present the accuracy of a baseline classifier that chooses shift-reduce operations randomly, with probabilities that reflect the probability distribution of the operations in each corpus. Figure 4 shows the learning curve that corresponds to the MUC corpus. As in the case of the discourse segmenter, this learning curve also suggests that more data can increase the accuracy of the shift-reduce action identifier. Evaluation of the rhetorical parser Obviously, by applying the two classifiers sequen-tiaUy, one can derive the rhetorical structure of any text. Unfortunately, the performance results presented in sections 4 and 5 only suggest how well the discourse segmenter and the shift-reduce action identifier perform with respect to individual cases. They say nothing about the performance of a rhetorical parser that relies on these classifiers. In order to evaluate the rhetorical parser as a whole, we partitioned randomly each corpus into two sets of texts: 27 texts were used for training and the last 3 texts were used for testing. The evaluation employs labeled recall and precision measures, which are extensively used to study the performance of syntactic parsers. Labeled recall reflects the number of correctly labeled constituents identified by the rhetorical parser with respect to the number of labeled constituents in the corresponding manually built tree. Labeled precision reflects the number of correctly labeled constituents identified by the rhetorical parser with respect to the total number of labeled constituents identified by the parser. We computed labeled recall and precision figures with respect to the ability of our discourse parser to identify elementary units, hierarchical text spans, text span nuclei and satellites, and rhetorical relations. Table 4 displays results obtained using segmenters and shift-reduce action identifiers that were trained either on 27 texts from each corpus and tested on 3 unseen texts from the same corpus; or that were trained on 27\u00d73 texts from all corpora and tested on 3 unseen texts from each corpus. The training and test texts were chosen randomly. Table 4 also displays results obtained using a manual discourse segmenter, which identified correctly all edus. Since all texts in our corpora were manually annotated by multiple judges, we could also compute an upper-bound of the performance of the rhetorical parser by calculating for each text in the test corpus and each judge the average labeled recall and precision figures with respect to the discourse trees built by the other judges. Table 4 displays these upper-bound figures as well. The results in table 4 primarily show that errors in the discourse segmentation stage affect significantly the quality of the trees our parser builds. When a segmenter is trained only on 27 texts (especially for the MUC and WSJ corpora, which have shorter texts than the Brown corpus), it has very low performance. Many of the intra-sentential edu boundaries are not identified, and as a consequence, the overall performance of the parser is low. When the segmenter is trained on 27 \u00d7 3 texts, its performance increases significantly with respect to the MUC and WSJ corpora, but decreases with respect to the Brown corpus. This can be explained by the significant differences in style and discourse marker usage between the three corpora. When a perfect segmenter is used, the rhetorical parser determines hierarchical constituents and assigns them a nuclearity status at levels of performance that are not far from those of humans. However, the rhetorical labeling of discourse spans is even in this case about 15-20% below human performance. These results suggest that the features that we use are sufficient for determining the hierarchical structure of texts and the nuclearity statuses of discourse segments. However, they are insufficient for determining correctly the elementary units of discourse and the rhetorical relations that hold between discourse segments. The rhetorical parser presented here is the first that employs learning methods and a thorough evaluation methodology. All previous parsers aimed at determining the rhetorical structure of unrestricted texts (Sumita et al., 1992; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Marcu, 1997; Corston-Oliver, 1998) employed manually written rules. Because of the lack of discourse corpora, these parsers did not evaluate the correctness of the discourse trees they built per se, but rather their adequacy for specific purposes: experiments carded out by Miike et al. (1994) and Marcu (1999) showed only that the discourse structures built by rhetorical parsers (Sumita et al., 1992; Marcu, 1997) can be used successfully in order to improve retrieval performance and summarize text. Conclusion In this paper, we presented a shift-reduce rhetorical parsing algorithm that learns to construct rhetorical structures of texts from tagged data. The parser has two components: a discourse segmenter, which identifies the elementary discourse units in a text; and a shift-reduce action identifier, which determines how these units should be assembled into rhetorical structure trees. Our results suggest that a high-performance discourse segmenter would need to rely on more training data and more elaborate features than the ones described in this paper --the learning curves did not converge to performance limits. If one's goal is, however, to construct discourse trees whose leaves are sentences (or units that can be identified at high levels of performance), then the segmenter described here appears to be adequate. Our results also suggest that the rich set of features that constitute the foundation of the action identifier are sufficient for constructing discourse hierarchies and for assigning to discourse segments a rhetorical status of nucleus or satellite at levels of performance that are close to those of humans. However, more research is needed in order to approach human performance in the task of assigning to segments correct rhetorical relation labels. Acknowledgements.
