Introduction Tile present paper represents the first attempt to integrate Mark Steedman's theory of Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG) [Ste90, Ste91] with Ray Jackendoff's theory of Conceptual Semantics [Jac90, ~lac91]. The former is known for its successhd treatment of tong-distance dependencies, coordination, and, more recently, matters of discourse focus relating to intonation---none of which have been treated within Conceptual Semantics. The latter is known for its de-velopment of conceptual structures, which are mental representations intended to serve as the link between language and other areas of cognition, e.g. vision, action and inference--which CCG stops short of. Since CCG is a. lexically oriented theory of grammar, the two are entirely compatible, as well as complementary. The immediate motivation to attempt such an integration, and the focus of the present paper, is CCG's incomplete treatment of sameness of role (i.e. thematic) information. In CCG, semantic function-argument structures are compositionally produced through the course of a derivation. These structures identify, inter alia, which entities play the same roles in different events for expressions involving a wide range of coordinate constructs. For example, the semantic functionargument structure shown in (lb) is derived for the sentence in (la) via type-raising, composition, and coordination of the bracketed non-standard constituent, following the analysis of Dowty [Dow88] : 1 (la) Jack filled [the urn with coffee] and [the thermos with milk]. (lb) (fill' urn' coffee' jack') & (fill' thermos' mill\" jack') Of course, such semantic function-argument structures are intended only for illustrative purposes; indeed, according to Steedman, semantic constants like urn' are \"mere placeholders for a real semantics, intended to do no more than illustrate this compositionality.\" Nevertheless, we may glean from these structures the requirement that urn' and thern*os' play the same semantic role, since they are both first arguments to fill', and likewise for coffee' and milk', since they are both second arguments. In the terminology of Conceptual Semantics, these requirements may be restated in terms of thematic roles as follows: urn' and lhermos' share the thematic role Goal in their respective events; like-1The semantic role of determiners and tenne will be ignored in this paper. Here it would not do to derive the function-argument structures shown in (3), as they incorrectly equate semantic roles in some eases, t'br example, the roles of jack\" and coffee\" are incorrectly said to be the same for Jack filled the urn and Coffee filled the urn. This problem may be avoided by introducing distinct constants ill//' (with possibly varying arities), as shown in (4). Note, however, that this approach is incomplete, insofar as it fails to equate any semantic roles across the functions til~ ', at least in the absence of further conditions on these functions. To handle these cases as well, the present paper demonstrates how to adapt the solution developed in Conceptual Semantics to fit tile CCG paradigm. This approach may be seen as one method of specifying, in a principled fashion, the further conditions on constants like filli' necessary to give a complete account of thematic role identities. 3 It should not be viewed, however, as a variant of purely syntactic approaches to verbal diathesis, such as the Unaccusative tlypothesis [Bur86] in GB, which posit movement between an underlying and a surface structure and traces to recover thematic roles) 2 This restatetaent is actually a cor~iderable atrengtheldngb as CCG is not committed to anything stronger thmt the individual thematic role view (cf. [Dow91D; thai is, it requi~s no nmre than jack' play the \"filler\" role, urn' and thermos' play the \"filled\" role, etc. 3Another viable approach is of course to use ntemffng postulates. A detailed discussion of these alternatives is beyond the scope of tiffs paper (though cf. the discussioa in [dacPO]). 4Agaln, cf. also [J~cgo 3 for independent aa-guments in favor of the Concepttml Sematltics approach. The essence of the present approach is to redefine the Linking Theory component of Conceptual Semantics in teals of CCG categories, so that derivations yield conceptual structures representing the desired thematic information; in this way no changes are required on the CCG side. While this redefinition is largely straightforward, an interesting problem arises ill the case of Conceptual Semantics' Incorporated Argument Adjuncts. In examining these, the paper shows that they cannot be treated as adjuncts in the CCG sense without introducing new machinery, nor without compromising the independence of the two theories. For this reason, the paper instead adopts the more traditionM approach of treating them as oblique arguments. 2 Preliminaries This section reviews the details of CCG mid Conceptual Semmltics needed to understand their integration. CCC=, Exan~ple (2) sullices to review the necessary details of CCG. A CCG deriw~tion starts with lexical lookup, which identifies the functional type and semantics of cach constituent. For example, the category of the verb fill needed for .lack filled the urn is as shown in (5): (5) ~ill := ($\\NP)/NP : fill_a' In this notation, a category consists of a syntactic category paired via an infix colon with a semantic function. Syntactic categories have arguments appearing to the right of slashes, results to the left. The direction of the slash indicates tile direction of tlle argument. Thus the syntactic category (S\\NP)/NP defines a fimction that takes all NP to tile right and returns a function from an NP on the left to an S. Categories may combine via forward or backward functional application, indicated as > and < in Figure 1 . Categories may also combine by other means such as composition, often yielding multiple derivations of the same string. For present purposes this is of no significance, as all of the derivations of will produce the stone compositional meaning. Derivations for the rest of the examples in (2) are quite similar, differing only in the lexically specified category for fill. Note that under the Zwarts and Verkuyl formalization, (7a) is roughly equivalent to the more familiar (7b). In addition to the ontological type Thing, an entity may be of type Place, Path, Event, State, Manner or Property. The Place in t, he urn, for example, would be represented as in (8a): At this point we may observe that representations in (9) -(11) capture the similarities and differences in semantic roles observed in tile arguments of the verb fill in (2). This follows straightforwardly from the inclusion of representations ( 9 ) mid ( 10 ) within (11), together with the semantic coindexation. Next we turn to a brief description of how these representations are constructed in [Jac90]. Two representative lexical entries, that of the stative Jill of (2c) and causative-inchoative fill of (2a), are shown below: l fill ] V __ NPj [[ FILLBE([Thing ]i, [IN([Thins ]j)]) ] (12) fill V _ _ NPj tpp with NPk] CS i INCH BE(k,[IN(j)]) ] 1 L FILL (13) in ( 12 ), the verb fill subcategorizes an object NP indexed j, as well as an external argument indexed i by convention. Sinfilarly, (13) subcategorizes an object NP and a wi~h-PP. Arguments to the verb are integrated into the above conceptual structure using the Argument Fusion Rule, which links the coindexed constituents in the obvious way, as long as they are semantically compatible. Linking Theory This section details how the Linking Theory component of Conceptual Semantics can be redefined in terms of CCG categories, so that derivations yield conceptual structures like (9) -(11). Before introducing Linking Theory, however, we shall first examine how tim version of Conceptual Semantics presented in the last section can he adapted to fit the CCG paradigm. As was suggested in ,Section 1, the present approach may be seen as specifying constraints on the constants ]Jill ' so that the desired thematic role identities are captured. This may be done by simply redefining lexical entries like (12) and (13) as follows: fill V S\\NP/NP ~ji. [ BE~i, itN(j)]) ] (14) fill V S \\ NP / PP(with) / NP CS(i, INCII(BE(k,[IN(j)]) ) ) 1 AjlS. AFF(i,j) FILL (15) IIere the subcategorization frmnes have been replaced by the appropriate CCG categories, and the conceptual structures have been made into the appropriate functions corresponding to the filli ' constants. Because this information is supplied lexically, no changes need be made on the CCG side. Thus conceptual structures for sentences like those in (la) and (2) may be easily derived with the addition of just a few more lexical items like those below: 6 Jack ] Given such lexical items, the constants appearing in (lb) and (4) may be replaced yielding fimctions like the first one appearing in Figure 2 , which is equivalent mudulo an appropriate definition of ]?-reduction to tile one appearing; beh)w it. Such a defnition must mirror that of Argument Fnsion, insofar as it must append features specified by tile argument to those specified 6This particular with-PP i6 treated aA semantically vacuoua, unlike (say) the ~ith-accompamment modifier. Tlirning now to the introduction of Linking Theory, we may observe that there is nothing in theory as presented to this point which would eliminate hypotheticM verbs such as delli~ below [Car88] ) which would have (19) meaning Jack filled the urn. (19) * The urn dellifed Jack. To capture such generalizations, Jackendoffproposes to eliminate rigid coindexation between syntactic and semantic structures, opting to introduce Linking Theory to handle this task instead. Lexieal entries are therefore modified to indicate only which conceptual constituents must be specified, and not which syntactic constituents must specify them. The selected conceptual arguments are annotated with an A, or A-marked. In present terms, this means changing entries like (15) to ones like ( 20 Note that if Actor \"~sem Patient and Subject -%yn Direct Object, then the ordering Aij (with indices as before) required for dellif is indeed ruled out by the Linking Principle. s As developed so far, tile status of the Linking Principle in the present framework is that of a filter on representations. The Linking Principle may be made more constructive by eliminating syntactic specifications from lexical entries, following (say) Rappaport and Levin [RL88] or Pinker [Pin89], deriving them instead via Linking Rules which obey the Linking Principle. :]ackendoff does not rule out this possibility, but chooses to develop instead an approach in which both syntactic and semantic subcategorization is retained. I shall part company with Jackendoff on this issue, as I find his arguments in favor of retaining subcategorization unconvincing. These arguments are twofold. First, verbs appear to idiosyncratically specify prepositions. Such verbs may be accommodated within the present framework by simply providing fully specified categories like (15). Second, and more interestingly, some Incorporated Argument Adjuncts arc syntactically obligatory. This argument presupposes, of course, a Observe that the syntactic ordering cannot be defined from the syntactic type if subjects are to precede complements. semantically the inverse of the with-Theme PP. Unlike empty, however, the PP is obligatory for r/d. This leads Jackdendoff to posit a lexieal entry like (26), in which the Theme is not A-marked but the PP is obligatory. Such lexical entries are then used to argue in favor of retaining syntactic subeategorizatiou. This rather unusual move does not seem to be necessary, however. ~ Consider the representation adopted in the present framework, appearing in (27). This representation adequately captures r/d's idiosyncratic selection facts by simply requiring the A-marking of the Theme, forcing the appearance of the with-PP. Of course, to the extent that the existence of lexical entries like (26) is called into question, the argument following from their existence becomes likewise suspect. Conclusion The present paper has suggested that Conceptual Semantics and Combinatory Categorial Grammar are compatible, even complementary theories. It has argued that (1) Conceptual Semantics need only be minimally modified to adapt it to tile CCG paradigm, thus providing CCG with a more complete account of thematic role identities, and (2) these changes need not affect CCG at all if Conceptual Semantics' Incorporated Argument Adjuncts are treated as oblique arguments. A Prolog implementation of the framework presented herein is currently in progress. Future work shall include the incorporation of temporal Modifying Adjuncts and Superordinate Adjuncts into the present framework, as well as the aspectual-type coercions or rules of eonstrual of [MS88, Jaegl] .

Incorporated Argument Adjuncts Jackendoff observes that with-PPs may specify an optional Theme argument across a wide range of verbs. This observation leads him to hypothesize that such with-Themes should not be treated as subcategorized arguments, bnt rather as adjuncts. Such au analysis is partieulary appealing in cases involving an incorporated Theme, such as butter, as in Jack butfeted ~he bread with that yacky stuff. 9 We shall see, however, that this analysis cannot be adapted into the present framework without adding substantial new machinery, 1\u00b0 nor without compromising the independence of the two theories. In contrast, the traditional oblique argument analysis will be seen to surmount these difficulties in a natural way. Jaekendoff's informal version of the With-Theme Adjunct Rule is repeated below: (22) With-Theme Adjunct Rule: In a sentence containing with NP in the VP, if the Theme position is not indexed in the verb's lexical entry, then the object of with cazl be interpreted as Theme. With ( 22 ) in mind, one might try to redefine (17) as follows: withTheme y (f x) Here with is defined as a function from an NP to a VPnit shtmld be noted that Jackendoif does not adequately address the issue of why the class of apread~ appropriate for the verb butter ia larger than the class apppopriate for the ,mue noun. l\u00b0As was done in m~ ear|ier vexalon of this paper. modifier, where the constant WithTheme stands in for the function that fuses the Theme with the specified NP. A sample syntactic derivation using ( 23 ) is shown in Figure 3 . There are two problems with adequately specifying the function withTh~me. First, one might question its introduction on theoretical grounds, as it marks a substantial departure from the simple rule (18), /3reduction as Argument Fusion, compromising the independence of the two theories. Second, there is an empirical problem of avoiding examples like (2c), * CoSec filled the urn wi~h decaf . In (22), Jackendoff stipulates that the Thenm position be unindexed in the verb's lexical entry. This argmneut indexing information is no longer available, however, at the point in the derivation in which the withThcm e constant is to perform its magic, since the function (f x) is already saturated. Again, while adequate fixes might be possible, any such approach would seem quite ad hoc. Instead of treating these wilh-PPs as adjuncts, we may rehrterpret Jackendoff's (22) as a Linking Rule for oblique with-Theme PP arguments. This rule would then bc just one of those necessary to derive the cate~ gory in (15) from tim lexical entry in (24) below; other rules would map Actors to Subject NPs, Patients to Direct Object NPs, etc. Note that in this entry the subcategorization of the Theme argmnent is indicated to be optional by tim curly braces: fill V (24) Under this formulation, both of the problen~q mentioned above disappear: first, the Theme's specifica~ tion again becomas like that of any other argument, and second, the ungrammatieality of * Coffee filled the urn with decal again becomes a straightforward consequence of the independently motivated (Neo) 0-Criterion. At this point we may return to Jaekeadoff's argument in favor of retaining syntactic subcategoriza~ tion. After having chosen to treat oblique argumeuts as Incorporated Arguumnt Adjuncts, Jackendoff then observes that they are not always optional. Rathcr than retreat, however, he suggests that these are cases of syntactic subcategorization not matching semantic subcategorization. For example, consider (25):",
