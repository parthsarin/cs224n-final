We eschew the use of extensive resources (particularly, large annotated corpora and lexicons), exploiting instead (i) pre-existing annotated corpora of Czech; (ii) an unannotated corpus of Russian. We show that our approach has benefits, and present what we believe to be one of the first full evaluations of a Russian tagger in the openly available literature. Introduction Morphological processing and part-of-speech tagging are essential for many NLP tasks, including machine translation, information retrieval and parsing. In this paper, we describe a resource-light approach to the tagging of Russian. Because Russian is a highly inflected language with a high degree of morpheme homonymy (cf. Table 1 1 ) the tags involved are more numerous and elaborate than those typically used for English. This complicates the tagging task, although as has been previously noted (Elworthy, 1995) , the increased complexity of the tags does not necessarily translate into a more demanding tagging task. Because no large annotated corpora of Russian are available to us, we instead chose to use an annotated corpus of Czech. Czech is sufficiently similar to Russian that it is reasonable to suppose that information about Czech will be relevant in some way to the tagging of Russian. The languages share many linguistic properties (free word order and a rich morphology which plays a considerable role in determining agreement and argument relationships). We created a morphological analyzer for Russian, combined the results with information derived from Czech and used the TnT (Brants, 2000) tagger in a number of differ- 1 All Russian examples in this paper are transcribed in the Roman alphabet.

To evaluate the results, we morphologically annotated (by hand) a small corpus of Russian: part of the translation of Orwell's \"1984\" from the MULTEXT-EAST project (V\u00e9ronis, 1996) . 2 Why TnT? Readers may wonder why we chose to use TnT, which was not designed for Slavic languages. The short answer is that it is convenient and successful, but the following two sections address the issue in rather more detail. The encoding of lexical information in TnT TnT records some lexical information in the emission probabilities of its second order Markov Model. Since Russian and Czech do not use the same words we cannot use this information (at least not directly) to tag Russian. Given this, the move from Czech to Russian involves a loss of detailed lexical information. Therefore we implemented a morphological analyzer for Russian, the output of which we use to provide surrogate emission probabilities for the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) . The details are described below in section 4.2. The modelling of word order in TnT Both Russian and Czech have relatively free word order, so it may seem an odd choice to use a Markov model (MM) tagger. Why should second order MM be able to capture useful facts about such languages? Firstly, even if a language has the potential for free word order, it may still turn out that there are recurring patterns in the progressions of parts-of-speech attested in a training corpus. Secondly, n-gram models including MM have indeed been shown to be successful for various Slavic languages, e.g., Czech (Haji\u010d et al., 2001) or Slovene (D\u017eeroski et al., 2000) ; although not as much as for English. This shows that the transitional information captured by the second-order MM from a Czech or Slovene corpus is useful for Czech or Slovene. 2 The present paper shows that transitional information acquired from Czech is also useful for Russian. Russian versus Czech A deep comparative analysis of Czech and Russian is far beyond the scope of this paper. However, we would like to mention just a number of the most important facts. Both languages are Slavic (Czech is West Slavonic, Russian is East Slavonic). Both have extensive morphology whose role is important in determining the grammatical functions of phrases. In both languages, the main verb agrees in person and number with subject; adjectives agree in gender, number and case with nouns. Both languages are free constituent order languages. The word order in a sentence is determined mainly by discourse. It turns out that the word order in Czech and Russian is very similar. For instance, old information mostly precedes new information. The \"neutral\" order in the two languages is Subject-Verb-Object. Here is a parallel Czech-Russian example from our development corpus: (1) a. Of course, not all utterances are so similar. Section 5.4 briefly mentions how to improve the utility of the corpus by eradicating some of the systematic differences. Realization The tag system We adopted the Czech tag system (Haji\u010d, 2000) for Russian. Every tag is represented as a string of 15 symbols each corresponding to one morphological category. For example, the word vidjela is assigned the tag VpFS---XR-AA---, because it is a verb (V), past participle (p), feminine (F), singular (S), does not distinguish case (-), possessive gender (-), possessive number (-), can be any person (X), is past tense (R), is not gradable (-), affirmative (A), active voice (A), and does not have any stylistic variants (the final hyphen). Czech often has formal and colloquial variants of the same morpheme); but there is also an immediate practical reason -the Czech tag system is very elaborate and specifically devised to serve multiple needs, while our tagset is designed solely to capture the core of Russian morphology, as we need it for our primary purpose of demonstrating the portability and feasibility of our technique. Still, our tagset is much larger than the Penn Treebank tagset, which uses only 36 non-punctuation tags (Marcus et al., 1993) . Morphological analysis In this section we describe our approach to a resource-light encoding of salient facts about the Russian lexicon. Our techniques are not as radical as previously explored unsupervised methods (Goldsmith, 2001; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000) , but are designed to be feasible for languages for which serious morphological expertise is unavailable to us. We use a paradigm-based morphology that avoids the need to explicitly create a large lexicon. The price that we pay for this is overgeneration. Most of these analyses look very implausible to a Russian speaker, but significantly increasing the precision would be at the cost of greater development time than our resource-light approach is able to commit. We wish our work to be portable at least to other Slavic languages, for which we assume that elaborate morphological analyzers will not be available. We do use two simple pre-processing methods to decrease the ambiguity of the results handed to the tagger -longest ending filtering and an automatically acquired lexicon of stems. These were easy to implement and surprisingly effective. Our analyzer captures just a few textbook facts about the Russian morphology (Wade, 1992), excluding the majority of exceptions and including information about 4 declension classes of nouns, 3 conjugation classes of verbs. In total our database contains 80 paradigms. A paradigm is a set of endings and POS tags that can go with a particular set of stems. Thus, for example, the paradigm in Table 3 is a set of inflections that go with the masculine stems ending on the \"hard\" consonants, e.g., slon 'elephant', stol 'table ' . Unlike the traditional notions of stem and ending, for us a stem is the part of the word that does not change within its paradigm, and the ending is the part of the word that follows such a stem. For example, the forms of the verb mo\u010d' 'can.INF': mogu '1sg', mo\u017ee\u0161' '2sg', mo\u017eet '3sg', etc. are analyzed as 0 NNMS1 ----------y NNMP1 ---------- a NNMS2 ----------ov NNMP2 ---------- u NNMS3 ----------am NNMP3 ---------- a NNMS4 ----------ov NNMP4 ---------- u NNMS4 ---------1 e NNMS6 ----------ax NNMP6 ---------- u NNMS6 ---------1 om NNMS7 ----------ami NNMP7 ---------- Table 3 : A paradigm for \"hard\" consonant masculine nouns the stem mo followed by the endings gu, \u017ee\u0161', \u017eet. A more linguistically oriented analysis would involve the endings u, e\u0161', et and phonological alternations in the stem. All stem internal variations are treated as suppletion. 3  Unlike the morphological analyzers that exist for Russian (Segalovich and Titov, 2000; Segalovich, 2003; Segalovich and Maslov, 1989; Kovalev, 2002; Mikheev and Liubushkina, 1995; Yablonsky, 1999; Segalovich, 2003; Kovalev, 2002 , among others) (Segalovich, 2003; Kovalev, 2002; Mikheev and Liubushkina, 1995; Yablonsky, 1999 , among others), our analyzer does not rely on a substantial manually created lexicon. This is in keeping with our aim of being resource-light. When analyzing a word, the system first checks a list of monomorphemic closed-class words and then segments the word into all possible prefix-stem-ending triples. 4 The result has quite good coverage (95.4%), but the average ambiguity is very high (10.9 tags/token), and even higher for open class words. We therefore have two strategies for reducing ambiguity. Longest ending filtering (LEF) The first approach to ambiguity reduction is based on a simple heuristic -the correct ending is usually one of the longest candidate endings. In English, it would mean that if a word is analyzed either as having a zero ending or an -ing ending, we would consider only the latter; obviously, in the vast majority of cases that would be the correct analysis. In addition, we specify that a few long but very rare endings should not be included in the maximum length calculation (e.g., 2nd person pl. imperative). Deriving a lexicon The second approach uses a large raw corpus 5 to generate an open class lexicon of possible stems with their paradigms. In this paper, we can only sketch the method, for more details see (Hana and Feldman, to appear) . It is based on the idea that open-class lemmata are likely to occur in more than one form. First, we run the morphological analyzer on the text (without any filtering), then we add to the lexicon those entries that occurred with at least a certain number of distinct forms and cover the highest number of forms. If we encounter the word talking, using the information about paradigms, we can assume that it is either the -ing form of the lemma talk or that it is a monomorphemic word (such as sibling). Based on this single form we cannot really say more. However, if we also encounter the forms talk, talks and talked, the former analysis seems more probable; and therefore, it seems reasonable to include the lemma talk as a verb into the lexicon. If we encountered also talkings, talkinged and talkinging, we would include both lemmata talk and talking as verbs. Obviously, morphological analysis based on such a lexicon overgenerates, but it overgenerates much less than if based on the endings alone. For example, for the word form partii of the lemma partija 'party', our analysis gives 8 possibilities -the 5 correct ones (noun fem sg gen/dat/loc sg and pl nom/acc) and 3 incorrect ones (noun masc sg loc, pl nom, and noun neut pl acc; note that only gender is incorrect). Analysis based on endings alone would allow 20 possibilities -15 of them incorrect (including adjectives and an imperative). Tagging We use the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) , an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for second order Markov models. We train the transition probabilities on Czech (1.5M tokens of the Prague Dependency Treebank (B\u00e9mov\u00e1 et al., 1999) ). We obtain surrogate emission probabilities by running our morphological analyzer, then assuming a uniform distribution over the resulting emissions. Experiments Corpora For evaluation purposes, we selected and morphologically annotated (by hand) a small portion from the Russian translation of Orwell's '1984'. This corpus contains 4011 tokens and 1858 types. For development, we used another part of '1984'. Since we want to work with minimal language resources, the development corpus is intentionally small -1788 tokens. We used it to test our hypotheses and tune the parameters of our tools. In the following sections, we discuss our experiments and report the results. Note that we do not report the results for tag position 13 and 14, since these positions are unused; and therefore, always trivially correct. Morphological analysis As can be seen from Table 4 , morphological analysis without any filters gives good recall (although on a non-fiction text it would probably be lower), but also very high average ambiguity. Both filters (the longest-ending filter and automatically acquired lexicon) reduce the ambiguity significantly; the former producing a considerable drop of recall, the latter retaining high recall. However, we do best if we first attempt lexical lookup, then apply LEF to the words not found. This keeps recall reasonably high at the same time as decreasing ambiguity. As expected, performance increases with the size of the unannotated Russian corpus used to generate the lexicon. All subsequent experimental results were obtained using this best filter combination, i.e., the combination of the lexicon based on the 1Mword corpus and LEF. Tagging Table 7 summarizes the results of our taggers on test data. Our baseline is produced by the morphological analyzer without any filters followed by a tagger randomly selecting a tag among the tags offered by the morphological analyzer. The direct-full tag column shows the result of the TNT tagger with transition probabilities obtained directly from the Czech corpus and the emission symbols based on the morphological analyzer with the best filters. To further improve the results, we used two techniques: (i) we modified the training corpus to remove some systematic differences between Czech and Russian (5.4); (ii) we trained batteries of taggers on subtags to address the data sparsity problem (5.5 and 5.6). Russification We experimented with \"russified\" models. We trained the TnT tagger on the Czech corpus with modifications that made the structure of training data look more like Russian. For example, plural adjectives and participles in Russian, unlike Czech, do not distinguish gender. ( Even though auxiliaries and the copula are the forms of the same verb byt' 'to be', both in Russian and in Czech, the use of this verb is different in the two languages. For example, Russian does not use an auxiliary to form past tense: (5) a. J\u00e1 I jsem aux 1sg psal. wrote 'I was writing/I wrote.' [Cz] b. Ja I pisal. wrote 'I was writing/I wrote.' [Ru] It also does not use the present tense copula, except for emphasis; but it uses forms of the verb byt' in some other constructions like past passive. We implemented a number of simple \"russifications\". The combination of random omission of the verb byt', omission of the reflexive clitics, and negation transformation gave us the best results on the development corpus. Their combination improves the overall result from 68.0% to 69.4%. We admit we expected a larger improvement. Sub-taggers One of the problems when tagging with a large tagset is data sparsity; with 1000 tags there are 1000 3 potential trigrams. It is very unlikely that a naturally occurring corpus will contain all the acceptable tag combinations with sufficient frequency to reliably distinguish them from the unacceptable combinations. However, not all morphological attributes are useful for predicting the attributes of the succeeding word (e.g., tense is not really useful for case). We therefore tried to train the tagger on individual components of the full tag, in the hope that each sub-tagger would be able to learn what it needs for prediction. This move has the additional benefit of making the tag set of each such tagger smaller and reducing data sparsity. We focused on the first 5 positions -POS (P), SubPOS (S), gender (g), number (n), case (c) and person (p). The selection of the slots is based on our linguistic intuition -for example it is reasonable to assume that the information about part-of-speech and the agreement features (gnc) of previous words should help in prediction of the same slots of the current word; or information about part-of-speech, case and person should assist in determining person. On the other hand, the combination of tense and case is prima facie unlikely to be much use for prediction. Indeed, most of our expectations have been met. The performance of some of the models on the development corpus is summarized in Table 5 . The bold numbers indicate that the tagger outperforms the full-tag tagger. As can be seen, the taggers trained on individual positions are worse than the full-tag tagger on these positions. This proves that a smaller tagset does not necessarily imply that tagging is easiersee (Elworthy, 1995) for more discussion of this interesting relation. Similarly, there is no improvement from the combination of unrelated slots -case and tense (ct) or gender and negation (ga). However, the combinations of (detailed) part-of-speech with various agreement features (e.g., Snc) outperform the full-tag tagger on at least some of the slots. Comparison with Xerox tagger A tagger for Russian is part of the Xerox language tools. We could not perform a detailed evaluation since the tool is not freely available. We used the online demo version of Xerox's Disambiguator 6 to tag a few sentences and compared the results with the results of our tagger. The Xerox tagset is much smaller than ours, it uses 63 tags, collapsing some cases, not distinguishing gender, number, person, tense etc. (However, it uses different tags for different punctuation, while we have one tag for all punctuation). For the comparison, we translated our tagset to theirs. On 201 tokens of the testing corpus, the Xerox tagger achieved an accuracy of 82%, while our tagger obtained 88%; i.e., a 33% reduction in error rate. A sample analysis is in Table 8 . Comparison with Czech taggers The numbers we obtain are significantly worse than the numbers reported for Czech (Haji\u010d et al., 2001) (95.16% accuracy); however, they use an extensive manually created morphological lexicon (200K+ entries) which gives 100.0% recall on their testing data. Moreover, they train and test their taggers on the same language. Ongoing Research We are currently working on improving both the morphological analysis and tagging. We would like to improve the recall of filters following morphological analysis, e.g., using n maximal values instead of 1, using some basic knowledge of derivational morphology, etc. We are incorporating phonological conditions on stems into the guesser module as well as trying to deal with different morphological phenomena specific to Russian, e.g., verb reflexivization. However, we try to stay language independent (at least within Slavic languages) as much as possible and limit the language dependent components to a minimum. Currently, we are working on more sophisticated russifications that would be still easily portable to other languages. For example, instead of omitting auxiliaries randomly, we want to use the syntactic information present in Prague Dependency Treebank to omit only the 'right' ones. If possible, we would like to avoid entirely throwing away the Czech emission probabilities, because our intuition tells us that there are useful lexical similarities between Russian and Czech, and that some suitable process of cognate detection will allow us to transfer information from the Czech to the Russian emission probabilities. Just as a knowledge of English words is sometimes helpful (modulo sound changes) when reading German, a knowledge of the Czech lexicon should be helpful (modulo character set issues) when reading Russian. We are seeking the right way to operationalize this intuition in our system, bearing in mind that we want a sufficiently general algorithm to make the method portable to other languages, for which we assume we have neither the time nor the expertise to undertake knowledge-intensive work. A potentially suitable cognate algorithm is described by (Kondrak, 2001) . Finally, we would like to extend our work to Slavic languages for which there are even fewer available resources than Russian, such as Belarusian, since this was the original motivation for undertaking the work in the first place.
