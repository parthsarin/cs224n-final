We briefly describe its user interface and architecture, as well as recent developments that include LSE search capabilities for Chinese. Introduction The idea for the Linguist's Search Engine originated in a simple frustration shared by many people who study language: the fact that so much of the argumentation in linguistic theory is based on subjective judgments. Who among us has not, in some talk or class, heard an argument based on a \"starred\" (deemed-ungrammatical) example, and whispered to someone nearby, Did that sound ok to you? because we thought it sounded fine? As Bard et al. (1996) put it, each linguistic judgment is a \"small and imperfect experiment'\". Sch\u00fctze (1996) and Cowart (1997) provide detailed discussion of instability and unreliability in such informal methods, which can lead to biased or even misleading results. Recent work on linguistics methodology draws on the perception literature in psychology to provide principled methods for eliciting gradient, rather than discrete, linguistic judgments (Sorace and Keller, 2005) . In addition, at least as far back as Rich Pito's 1992 tgrep, distributed with the Penn Treebank, computationally sophisticated linguists have had the option of looking at naturally occurring data rather than relying on constructed sentences and introspective judgments (e.g., Christ, 1994; Corley et al., 2001; Blaheta, 2002; Kehoe and Renouf 2002; K\u00f6nig and Lezius, 2002; Fletcher 2002; Kilgarriff 2003 ). Unfortunately, many linguists are unwilling to invest in psycholinguistic methods, or in the computational skills necessary for working with corpus search tools. A variety of people interested in language have moved in the direction of using Web search engines such as Google as a source of naturally occurring data, but conventional search engines do not provide the mechanisms needed to perform many of the simplest linguistically informed searches -e.g., seeking instances of a particular verb used only intransitively. The Linguist's Search Engine (LSE) was designed to provide the broadest possible range of users with an intuitive, linguistically sophisticated but user-friendly way to search the Web for naturally occurring data. Section 2 lays out the LSE's basic interface concepts via several illustrative examples. Section 3 discusses its architecture and implementation. Section 4 discusses the current status of the LSE and recent developments. LSE Interface Concepts The design of the LSE was guided by a simple basic premise: a tool can't be a success unless people use it. This led to the following principles in its design: \u2022 Minimize learning/ramp-up time. \u2022 Have a linguist-friendly look and feel. \u2022 Permit rapid interaction. \u2022 Permit large-scale searches. \u2022 Allow searches using linguistic criteria. Some of these principles conflict with each other. For example, sophisticated searches are difficult to specify in a linguist-friendly way and without requiring some learning by the user, and rapid interaction is difficult to accomplish for Web-sized searches. Query By Example The LSE adopts a strategy one can call \"query by example,\" in order to provide sophisticated search functionality without requiring the user to learn a complex query language. For example, consider the so-called \"comparative correlative\" construction (Culicover and Jackendoff, 1999) . Typing the bigger the house the richer the buyer automatically produces the analysis in Figure 1 , which can be edited with a few mouse clicks to get the generalized structure in Figure 2 , converted with one button push into the LSE's query language, and then submitted in order to find other examples of this construction, such as The higher the rating, the lower the interest rate that must be paid to investors; The more you bingo, the more chances you have in the drawing; The more we plan and prepare, the easier the transition. Crucially, users need not learn a query language, although advanced users can edit or create queries directly if so desired. Nor do users need to agree with (or even understand) the LSE's automatic parse, in order to find sentences with parses similar to the exemplar. Indeed, as is the case in Figure 1 , the parse need not even be entirely reasonable; what is important is that the structure produced when analyzing the query will be the same structure produced via analysis of the corresponding sentences in the corpus. Other search features include the ability to specify immediate versus non-immediate dominance; the ability to negate relationships (e.g. a VP that does not immediately dominate an NP); the ability to specify that words should match on all morphological forms; the ability to match nodes based on WordNet relationships (e.g. all descendants of a particular word sense); the ability to save and reload queries; the ability to download results in keyword-in-context (KWIC) format; and the ability to apply a simple keywordbased filter to avoid offensive results during live demonstrations. Results are typically returned by the LSE within a few seconds, in a simple search-engine style format. In addition, however, the user has rapid access to the immediate preceding and following contexts of returned sentences, their annotations, and the Web page where the example occurred. Built-In and Custom Collections Linguistically annotating and indexing the entire Web is beyond impractical, and therefore there is a clear tradeoff between rapid response time and the ability to search the Web as a whole. In order to manage this tradeoff, the LSE provides, by default, a built-in collection of English sentences taken randomly from a Web-scale crawl at the Internet Archive. 1 This static collection is often useful by itself. In order to truly search the entire Web, the LSE permits users to define their own custom collections, piggybacking on commercial Web search engines. Consider, as an example, a search involving the verb titrate, which is rare enough that it occurs only twice in a collection of millions of sentences. Using the LSE's \"Build Custom Collection\" functionality, the user can specify that the LSE should: \u2022 Query Altavista to find pages containing any morphological form of titrate \u2022 Extract only sentences containing that verb \u2022 Annotate and index those sentences \u2022 Augment the collection by iterating this process with different specifications Doing the Altavista query and extracting, parsing, and indexing the sentences can take some time, but the LSE permits the user to begin searching his or her custom collection as soon as any sentences have been added into it. Typically dozens to hundreds of sentences are available within a few minutes, and a typical custom collection, containing thousands or tens of thousands of sentences, is completed within a few hours. Collections can be named, saved, augmented, and deleted. Currently the LSE supports custom collections built using searches on Altavista and Microsoft's MSN Search. It is interesting to note that the search engines' capabilities can be used to create custom collections based on extralinguistic criteria; for example, specifying pages originating only in the .uk domain in order to increase the likelihood of finding British usages, or specifying additional query terms in order to bias the collection toward particular topics or domains. Architecture and Implementation The LSE's design can be broken into the following high level components: \u2022 User interface \u2022 Search engine interface \u2022 NLP annotation \u2022 Indexing \u2022 Search The design is centered on a relational database that maintains information about users, collections, documents, and sentences, and the implementation combines custom-written code with significant use of off-the-shelf packages. The interface with commercial search engines is accomplished straightforwardly by use of the WWW::Search perl module (currently using a custom-written variant for MSN Search). Natural language annotation is accomplished via a parallel, database-centric annotation architecture (Elkiss, 2003) . A configuration specification identifies dependencies between annotation tasks (e.g. tokenization as a prerequisite to part-ofspeech tagging). After documents are processed to handle markup and identify sentence boundaries, individual sentences are loaded into a central database that holds annotations, as well as information about which sentences remain to be annotated. Crucially, sentences can be annotated in parallel by task processes residing on distributed nodes. Indexing and search of annotations is informed by the recent literature on semistructured data. However, linguistic databases are unlike most typical semistructured data sets (e.g., sets of XML documents) in a number of respects -these include the fact that the dataset has a very large schema (tens of millions of distinct paths from root node to terminal symbols), long path lengths, a need for efficient handling of queries containing wildcards, and a requirement that all valid results be retrieved. On the other hand, in this application incremental updating is not a requirement, and neither is 100% precision: results can be overgenerated and then filtered using a less efficient comparison tools such as tgrep2. Currently the indexing scheme follows ViST (Wang et al., 2003) , an approach based on suffix trees that indexes structure and content together. The variant implemented in the LSE ignores insufficiently selective query branches, and achieves more efficient search by modifying the ordering within the structural index, creating an inmemory tree for the query, ordering processing of query branches from most to least selective, and memoizing query subtree matches. Status and Recent Developments The LSE \"went live\" on January 20, 2004 and approximately 1000 people have registered and tried at least one query. In response to a recent survey, several dozen LSE users reported having tried it more than casually, and there are a dozen or so reports of the LSE having proven useful in real work, either for research or as a tool that was useful in teaching. Resnik et al. (2005) describe two pieces of mainstream linguistics researchone in psycholinguistics and one in theoretical syntax -in which the LSE played a pivotal role. The LSE software is currently being documented and packaged up, for an intended open-source release. 2 In addition to continuing linguistic research with the LSE, we are also experimenting with alternative indexing/search schemes. Finally, we are engaged in a project adapting the LSE for use in language pedagogyspecifically, as a tool assisting language teaching specialists in creating training and testing materials for learners of Chinese. For that purpose, we are experimenting with a built-in collection of Chinese Web documents that includes links to their English translations (Resnik and Smith, 2003) .
