Introduction This paper presents a tool to facilitate a rigorous empirically oriented study on the design and use of multimodal instructions (MIs), i.e., instructions that contain both text and pictures. MIs are ubiquitous in all walks of modern life (medicine, electronics, flatpack furniture, recipes, etc.). In general, it has been established that including pictures in information presentation is beneficial for readers and users (e.g., Glenberg and Roberts, 1999; Kjelldahl, 1992; Mayer, 2009; Schriver, 1997) . But what are the characteristics of the pictures, texts and the relation(s) between them in these presentations? To illustrate the abundant variety of presentational aspects in MIs and the apparent lack of authoring guidelines, Figures 1 and 2 present two MIs for operating an automated external defibrillator (AED). Already at first sight the two instructions differ in numerous ways, e.g. the number of steps, the number of actions to carry out per step, the type of pictures, layout in terms of columns and rows, the amount of text (per step), the occurrence and type of arrows used in pictures, the use of indices, labels and references. Our main goal is to systematically investigate how text and pictures are best combined in MIs in terms of effectiveness in their context of use. For now, we consider primarily MIs in health communication. Our corpus-based studies will allow investigation of the breadth of instructional design, while existing studies on MIs (Houts et al., 2006; Katz et al., 2006) generally focus on human processing of particular instructions. Outcomes of our work will aid (semi-)automatic annotation, evaluation and generation of MIs as well as the formulation of authoring guidelines on how to combine text and pictures effectively according to judgments and performance of readers and users and dependent on, for instance, the function of the MI (e.g., to learn a task or to perform a task only once). Various tools exist for picture annotation (e.g., Cusano et al., 2003 , Russel et al., 2008 ), text annotation (e.g., Erdman et al., 2000; Ogren, 2006; Stenetorp et al., 2012) and video annotation (e.g., Brugman & Russel, 2004; Do et al., 2016; Kipp, 2001) . However, to our knowledge only the UAM tool (O'Donnell 2008) supports the annotation of both text and pictures. UAM supports semiautomatic tagging of text and allows parts of pictures to be selected and labelled, but not to our knowledge relational annotations. In this paper we present the PAT Workbench for annotation, storage and retrieval of MIs. The workbench supports manual annotation based on a coding scheme that describes MIs in terms of the factors that potentially influence the effectiveness of MIs. The 42 categories of the coding scheme were inspired by studies on human processing of multimodal presentations (e.g., Arts et al., 2011; Dupont & Bestgen, 2006; Florax & Ploetzner, 2010; Heiser & Tversky 2006; Van Hooijdonk & Krahmer, 2008; Maes & Noordman, 2004; Morrow et al., 2005) . Like UAM (O'Donnell, 2008) and Anvil (Kipp, 2001) , the workbench includes inter-annotator agreement calculation and a method to resolve any differences between annotations and obtain a gold standard annotation. In Section 2 we present the PAT Workbench, In Section 3, we present an overview of our current MI corpus with 194 annotated first-aid instructions. In Section 4, we conclude with a discussion of future work on the PAT Workbench. Figure 2 : AED MIT by ProCardio.nl. The PAT Workbench System description The PAT Workbench is an online tool that was built to facilitate the annotation, storage and retrieval of MIs collected by master students in Communication and Information Sciences at the University of Groningen. Each year, about 200 new annotated MIs are added to the corpus. These MIs concern firstaid tasks like applying a band-aid, removing ticks, or reanimating a person. The PAT Workbench is a web application written in PHP using the CodeIgniter Framework 1 . The design of the website features a Bootstrap 2 template called Dark Admin 3 . Data creation and manipulation is facilitated through a MySQL database. This relational database structure allows an efficient design of connections between concepts such as users, user groups, group assignments, documents and annotations. Documents are not stored in this database, but in a separate directory structure where each document is linked by its identification code to its entry in the database (which contains the metadata). The current version of the PAT Workbench has a menu structure with five main topics: Search, Add, Assignment, Manual, Collection and Manual, and includes the following functionalities: \u2022 Detailed MI search system with filtering options Adding MIs Users of the PAT Workbench can add (sets of) MIs in PDF format to their own corpus via the menu item 'Add'. A user becomes the owner of MIs that he/she adds from the collection of free MIs in the MI corpus and of the new MIs that he/she uploads to the workbench. When uploading MIs, the user is prompted to select a set of documents. For each document the user needs to specify some metadata about the MI it contains (e.g., title, description, target audience, background information, source), aided by a simultaneously offered view of the MI (see Figure 3 ). Based on the metadata, the system checks if the MI is not uploaded already. To make sure that no duplicates exist, the user can also manually check the uploaded MIs based on a keyword search that retrieves MIs using the metadata; the retrieved MIs can be browsed and inspected with a simple document viewer. In addition, uploaded PDF documents are converted to plain text using OCR (ABBYY 4 ). Annotation panel Figure 4 presents the annotation panel. The grey part of the screen offers a two-column view of an uploaded MI. The left side offers either a view of the document as it was uploaded to the PAT Workbench, a view of OCR output, the annotation manual, or the annotation history of the document. The right side presents a tabulated view of the main annotation categories: (1) function, (2) text, (3) pictures and (4) text-picture relations. The annotation scheme used in the PAT Workbench is the improved version of a scheme that was used by 13 annotators who annotated a corpus of 227 health care instructions (Van Dijk et al. 2016 ). The corpus described in Section 3 was annotated with the improved scheme. In Tables 1 to 4 below the scheme is presented in terms of the four main categories, including their subcategories with values. Note that the illocutionary properties of text and pictures are defined so that they can be aligned in terms of actions and control information. Correspondences between text and pictures are defined in terms of number of steps, indices and layout. Future work will also consider relations in terms of implements, agents and actions. Other extensions will include annotations of MIs per picture and per textual unit. Currently all annotations concern the MI as a whole. Collaborative annotation The PAT Workbench administrator can formulate a collaboration assignment for a particular group of users, and the members of the group can then invite other members to annotate a subset of the MIs they own using the collaboration panel. The collaboration panel includes a progress indicator for the annotations. Agreement between two annotations of each MI is calculated per subcategory to help the 'owner' of the MI to double-check and improve the annotation, which the administrator then adds to the MI corpus as the gold standard annotation of the MI. MI Retrieval MIs of which the annotation is agreed on by at least two annotators and which have thus been added to the gold standard annotated corpus, can be retrieved via the main menu item 'Search'. The link points to a panel with two tabs (Figure 5 ), one to perform an extensive search and one to browse the database. The latter option offers a tiled view of all MIs in the corpus that includes a picture of the MIs and the metadata (i.e. title, description, uploader, owner, target audience, source, web address and date). The extensive search offers a keyword search, which can be augmented with the values of the subcategories presented in italics in Tables 1 to 4 . The output of the PhP-based search engine is displayed with the simple MI browser that is also used to browse the corpus, which allows selection and display of individual MIs. Manuals and documentation The PAT Workbench includes an illustrated annotation manual (Van Dijk et al. 2016) which is available in PDF format via the main menu as well as via the annotation panel. In addition, the system itself is documented at the installation/use level, code level, and database level. Administrator Interface to manage MIs and Users The administrator interface includes three different administration panels: \u2022 On the User panel, the administrator may add or remove users of three types (student, researcher, administrator) or edit details of users (i.e. name, student number, email address and type). \u2022 On the Group panel, the administrator can create a user group for a particular time span. For each group the administrator can add and remove users and formulate collaboration assignments. \u2022 On the Corpus panel, the administrator can edit and remove MIs. The administrator may also unlock MIs from their owners to allow other users to change or extend the annotations. In all cases 'remove' means 'flag as inactive or invisible', as no user or MI is actually removed from the database to allow restore and repair. Evaluation and Usability Currently, an extensive evaluation of the system is in progress. A preliminary task-based user study on the administrator interface included an observation of the administrator (the first author of this paper) performing tasks while thinking aloud. She had not seen the administrator interface before, but was closely involved in the design and implementation of the underlying functionality. After she had performed the tasks assigned to her, she filled out two standard usability questionnaires, SUS (Brook, 1986) and CSUQ (Lewis, 1995) , and was interviewed by the experimenter who asked her to reflect on her task performance and the way she filled out the questionnaires. Observations of the task-based performance brought to light various flaws that are currently being remedied. Most prominent were issues with system feedback (e.g., system confirmations, visual cues, mouse-over information) and uniformity (e.g., potential user actions are indicated with buttons as well as icons). Overall this (admittedly biased) evaluation was very positive, but also identified a number of minor points where the interface could be improved. After the implementation of those improvements, an analysis of the PAT Workbench is currently being conducted by an independent expert who will perform a functional analysis, a heuristic inspection of the whole application, identification of the main tasks and a cognitive walkthrough of these main tasks. A more extensive user study with potential users of the PAT Workbench will be conducted inspecting the usability of the PAT Workbench in terms of its main tasks using a thinkaloud protocol, usability questionnaires and interviews. MI corpus The annotated MI corpus currently contains 192 MIs, 166 of which are designed for adult users, 9 for children and 17 for medics. The MI functions are distributed as follows: reading-to-do (120), readingto-learn (85), reading-to-decide-during-instruction ( 17 ), and reading-to-decide-after-instruction (6); some MIs have multiple functions. Thirteen annotators familiar with the annotation scheme annotated, double-checked and agreed on the annotations of 106 MIs, subsequently the annotators coded 86 new MIs. The annotation of linguistic properties shows that the mean number of steps in the MIs is 5.78, varying from 1 to 14. The mean number of sentences in the MIs is 10.37, varying from 1 to 41. The mean number of imperatives in the MIs is 6.93, ranging from 0 (24 MIs) to 25. The mean number of anaphora used is 1.01, where 90 MIs do not include any anaphora and the maximum number of anaphora used in an MI is 11. Table 5 presents counts of illocutionary properties of text and pictures in the 192 MIs. By far the most text segments and pictures refer to compulsory actions. Conditionals, motivations, and advisements cannot be reliably identified in pictures and were thus only annotated for the texts. The annotation of visual properties shows that the mean number of pictures included in the MIs is 4.25 ranging from 1 to 23. In 66 MIs these pictures are photographs, 125 MIs use drawings and one MI uses a combination of photographs and drawings. The total of 816 pictures include 95 instances of text in picture and 8 instances of pictograms, 258 arrows and 12 time indications. Human body parts are included in 764 pictures. Pictures are used for identification purposes in 535 cases and for localisation purposes in 28 cases. While actions are usually referred to by action verbs in the text, pictures often present not the process, but the results (439 pictures) or partial results of actions (302 pictures). Text Annotation of text-picture relations reveals a correspondence in 71 MIs in terms of the number of steps in the text and the number of pictures. In 27 MIs text and pictures are connected through numbering, 28 MIs use lines, 32 MIs use blocks and 13 MIs use titles. In 21 MIs textual references to pictures are included ranging from 1 (8 MIs) to 14 (1 MI). Future Work The current version of the PAT Workbench will be improved based on results from the planned expert and user evaluations. Additional functionalities we envisage include: \u2022 Recognition of the document structure where OCR fails due to e.g., columns and pictures in the MIs. Fully parsed MIs will allow for automatic tagging of lexical and grammatical features and will considerably reduce the need for manual annotation of linguistic text features as presented in Table 2 . Currently, the Alpino parser (Van Noord, 2006 ) is used for simple NLP tasks like counting words and sentences. \u2022 Development and implementation of an algorithm to annotate illocutionary aspects of text and pictures in MIs. \u2022 Annotation of individual pictures and textual units, which allow description of individual picturetext relations. These relations will include actions or illocutionary aspects that are described and visualised. As implemented in the UAM tool for pictures (O'Donnell, 2008) , identification and annotation of features of pictures is envisioned. \u2022 Development and implementation of an evaluation algorithm that scores features of MIs in terms of predicting readers' and users' ratings of the quality of MIs. These ratings will be based on crowdsourcing experiments in which readers are asked to rate MIs as well as on empirical studies in which users perform the actions instructed in MIs. \u2022 A more extensive administrator panel will be implemented that allows a dynamic annotation scheme, i.e. to add new and disable existing annotation categories and their values. Obviously, these changes need to be made in tandem with the search options and the method used to calculate inter-annotator agreement. \u2022 An English interface will be provided to improve the system's accessibility. Implementation of automatic methods for annotation and evaluation will allow us to annotate larger amounts of MIs and thus to extend and generalise the workbench to process other types of MIs (e.g., indoor navigation, cooking recipes, construction manuals) and possibly instruction videos in the future.",
