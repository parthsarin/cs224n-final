Introduction in order to Support the efficient development of NL generation systems, two orthogonal methods are currently pursued with emphasis: (1) reusable, general, and linguistically motivated surface realization components, and (2) simple, task-oriented template-based techniques. Surface realization components impose a layer of intermediate representations that has become fairly standard, such as the Sentence Plan Language (SPL) [Kasper and Whitney, 1989 ]. This layer allows for the use of existing software with well-defined interfaces, often reducing the development effort for surface realization considerably. Template-based \u2022techniques recently had some sort of revival through several application-oriented projects such as IDAS [Reiter et al.; 1995] , that combine pre-defined surface expressions with freely generated text in one or another way. However, the benefits of both surface realization components and template-based techniques are still limited from an application-oriented perspective. Surface realization components are difficult to use because of the differences between domain-oriented and linguistically \u2022motivated ontologies (as in SPL), and existing template-based \u2022 techniques are too inflexible. In this paper we Suggest and evaluate flexible shallow methods for report generation applications requiring limited linguistic resources that are adaptable with little effort. We advise a close connection between domain-motivated and linguistic ontologies, and we suggest a layer of intermediate representation that is oriented towards the domain and the given task. This layer may contain representations of different granularity, some highly implicit, others very elaborate. We show how this is used by the processing components in a beneficial way. 1This work has beensupported by a grant for theproject TEMSIS from the European Union (Telematics Applications Programme, Sector C9, contract no. 2945). I i I ,I I ,[I I The approach suggested does not only change the modularization generally assumed for NLG systems drastically, it also renders the system much more application-dependent. At first glance, however, such an approach seems to abandon generality and reusability completely, but, as we will demonstrate, this is not necessarily the case. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section\u20222 identifies deficits with current approaches to surface realization that may occur for particular applications. In Section 3 we propose alternative methods implemented into our sample application, the generation of air-quali\u2022ty reports from current environmental data. In Section 4 we discuss the pros and cons of our approach, and we summarize the conditions for successful use. In-Depth and Shallow Generation Shallow generation Recently, the distinction between in-depth and Shallow approaches to language processing has emerged from the need to build sensible applications. In language understanding deep analysis attempts to \"understand\" every part of the input, while shallow analysis tries to identify only parts of interest for a particular application. Shallow analysis is a key concept for information extraction from huge text bases and many other real-world application types. In language generation a corresponding distinction which we term in-depth vs. shallow genera. tion 2 is becoming prominent. While in-depth generation is inherently knowledge-based and theoretically motivated, shallow generation quite opportunistically models only the parts of interest for the application in hand. Often such models will turn out to be extremely shallow and simple, but in other cases much more detail is required. Thus, developing techniques for varying modeling granularity according to the requirements posed by the application is a prerequisite for more custom-tailored systems. According to Reiter and Mellish, shallow techniques (which they call \"intermediate\") are appropriate as long as corresponding in-depth approaches are poorly understood, less efficient, or more costly to develop [Reiter and Mellish, 1993] ] While our motivation for shallow techniques is in essence based on the cost factor,\u2022 our assessment is even more pronounced than Reiter's and Mellish's in that we claim that shallow approaches combining different granularity in a flexible way are better suited for small applications. We are convinced that shallow generation systems will have a similar impact on the development of feasible applications as shallow analyzers. Potential shortcomings of approaches to surface realization Current approaches to surface realization are mostly in-depth, based on general, linguistically motivated, and widely reusable realization components, such as Penman [Penman, 1989] , KPML [Bateman, 1997], and SURGE [Elhadad and Robin, 1996] . These components are domain-independent \u2022 and based on Sound linguistic principles. KPML and SURGE also exhibit a broad coverage of English, while sevhral other language models are also available or under development. Despite their being reusable in general, the fact that the modularization of grammatical knowledge follows linguistic criteria rather than the needs of different types of applications may cause a number of problems for an efficient development of concrete applications: 2\"vVe thus avoid confusion with the common distinction between deep and surface generation. \u2022 The substantial differences between domain-and linguistically motivated ontologies may render the mapping between them difficult; for instance, the use of case relations such as \"agent\" or \"objective\" requires compatible models of deep case semantics. \u2022 The need to encapsulate grammar knowledge within the surface realizer may require details in the intermediate representation to be spelled out that are irrelevant to the intended application, even for rather Small systems. \u2022 The fixed granularity of grammatical modeling requires a realizer to cover many more languages, language fragments, or stylistic variations than would be needed for one particular application, which can lead to a considerable inefficiency of the realizer. In addition, there may be linguistic constructs needed for some applications that are still outside the scope of the general tool. Their inclusion may require the intermediate representation layer\u2022 to bemodified. Potential shortcomings of shallow generation methods A prominent example for an early shallow generation system is Ana [Kukich, 1983] , which reports about stock market developments. While the kind of texts it produces can still be considered valuable today, Ana is implemented as a Widely unstructured rule-based system, which does not seem to be easily \u2022extendable and portable. Since then, various shallow methods including canned text parts and some template-based techniques have been utilized, e.g. in CogentHelp [White and Caldwell, 1997 ], in the system described in [Cawsey et al., 1995] , and in IDAS [Reiter et al., 1995] . They feature simplicity where the intended application does not require fine-grained distinctions, such as the following techniques used in IDAS: \u2022 canned text with embedded KB references (\"Carefully slide [x] out along its guide\"), \u2022 case frames with textual slot fillers, (\"gently\" in (manner : \"gently\")). Although these techniques seem to be able to provide the necessary distinctions for many practical applications in a much simpler way than in-depth surface realization components can do, a serious limitation lies in their inflexibility. The first example above requires the realization of Ix] to agree in number with the canned part; as this is not explicitly \u2022treated, the system seems to implicitly \"know\" that only singular descriptions will be inserted. Moreover, canned texts as case role fillers may bear contextual influence, too, such as pronominals, or word order phenomena. Thus, the flexibility of shallow generation techniques should be increased significantly. Shallow Generation in TEMSIS In order to tailor-the design of a generation system towards an application, we must account for different levels of granularity. We need a formalism capable of adapting to the expressivity of the domain-oriented information. Parts of the texts to be generated may be canned, some require templates, others require a more elaborate grammatical model. In this section we first introduce an instance of the kind of applications we have in mind. We then \u2022proceed by discussing aspects of different granularity from the point of view of the intermediate representation (IR) layer and the components it interfaces. These include text organization and text realization. The text organizer is also responsible for content selection. It retrieves the relevant data from the TEMSIS database. It combines fixed text blocks with the results of the realizer in a language-neutral way. IR expressions are consumed by the text realizer, which is a version of the production system TG/2 described in [Busemann, 1996] . 3.1 The TEMSIS application With TEMSIS a Transnational Environmental Management Support and Information System was created as part of a transnational cooperation between the communities in the French-German urban agglomeration, Moselle Est and Stadtverband SaarbriJcken. Networked information kiosks are being installed in a number of communities to provide public and expert environmental information. The timely availability of relevant environmental information will improve the planning and reactive capabilities of the administration considerably. Current measurement data are made available on the TEMSIS web server. The data include the pollutant, the measurement values, the location and the time the measurements were taken, and a variety of thresholds. Besides such data, the server provides metadata that allow for descriptions of the measuring locations, of the pollutants measured and of regulations or laws according to which a comparison between measurements and thresholds can be performed. This information can be accessed via the internet through a hyperlink navigation interface (http ://www-temsi s. dfki. uni-sb, de/). The verbalization of NL air quality information in German and French is an additional service reducing the need to look up multiple heterogeneous data. The generated texts can be complemented with diagrams of time series. The material can be edited andlfurther \u2022processed by the administrations to fit additional needs. In order to request a report, a user specifies his demand by choosing from a hierarchy of options presented to him within the hyperlink navigation interface. He selects a report type by indicating whether he is interested in average values, maximum values, or situations where thresholds are exceeded. Further choices include the language, the country the environmental legislation of which should apply, the measurement location, the pollutant, the period of time for which measurements should be retrieved, and in some cases comparison parameters. In addition, descriptions of pollutants and measurement stations can be requested. They are stored as canned texts in the TEMSIS database: Not all choices are needed in every case, and the TEMSIS navigator\u2022restricts the combination of choices to the meaningful ones. Let us assume that the user wants a French text comparing thresholds for sulfur dioxide with measurements taken in the winter period of 1996/97 at VSlklingen City, and the applicable legislation should be from Germany. He also wants a confirmation of some of his choices. The user \u2022 receives the following text on his browser 3 (translated into English for the reader's convenience): You would like information about the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air during-the \u2022 winter season 1996/97. At the measurement station of VSlklinge n City, the early warning threshold for sulfur dioxide at an exposition of three hours (600 /zg/m 3 according to the German decree \"Smogverordnung\") was not exceeded, in winter 1995/96, the early warning threshold was not exceeded either. 3A demo version of the system is available at http://wnT.dfki.de/service/nlg-demo/. Reports are organized into one or several paragraphs. Their length may range from a few lines to a page. En hive r 1996/97 ~ la station de mesure de V6lklingen-City , le seuil d'avertissement pour le dioxide de soufre pour une exposition de trois heures (600.0 #g/m 3 selon le decret allemand \"Smogverordnung\") n'a pas dt~ dgpassde. 3.2 The intermediate representation The main purpose of the IR layer for the report generation system consists in ensuring that all facets of the domain with \u2022their different degrees of specificity can be verbally expressed, and in keeping the realization task simple when no or little variety in language is needed. While SPL and similar languages interfacing to in-depth surface realization are either linguistic in nature or largely constrain the surface form of an utterance, the IR specifies domain information to be conveyed to the user and logical predicates about it. Abstracting away from language-specific information in the IR like this has the additional advantage that multi-lingual aspects can be kept internal to the realizer. They depend on the LANGUAGE feature in an IR expression. The IR in Figure 1 roUghly corresponds to the key statement of the sample report in the previous section (the second sentence), which also appears at the end of each report as a summary. It constitutes a threshold comparison, as stated bythe value of the C001 ~4 slot. There is only little indication as to how IR exlSressions should be expressed linguistically. Many semantic relations between the elements of an IR expression are left implicit. For instance, the value of DURATION relates to the time of exposure according to the threshold's definition and not to the period of time the user is interested in (TIME). Another example is the relation between EXCEEDS and THRESHOLD-VALUE, . which leads to the message that the early warning threshold was not exceeded at all. Wordings are not prescribed. For instance, our sample IR does not contain a basis for the generation of \"exposure\" or \"measurement station\". IR expressions, contain specifications at different degrees of granularity. For coarse-grained specifications, it is up to the text realizer to make missing or underspecified parts explicit on the surface so that, in a sense, shallow text realization determines parts of the contents. For more fine-grained specifications , such as time expressions, text realization behaves like a general surface 4The C00P value can correspond to the report type, as in the example, to confirmations of user choices, or to meta comments such as an introductory statement to a diagram, generated by a dedicated component. generator with a fully-detailed interface. Ensuring an appropriate textual realization from IR expressions is left to the language template design within the realizer. The syntax of IR expressions is defined by a standard Backus-Naur form. All syntactically correct expressions have a compositional semantic interpretation and can be realized as a surface text provided corresponding realization rules are defined.\u2022 Sharing the IR definitions between the text organization and the realization component thus avoids problems of realizability described in [Meteer, 1992] . Text organization The goal of text organization in our context is to retrieve and express, in terms suitable for the definition of the IR, (1) report specifications provided by the user, (2) the relevant domain data accessed from the database according to these specifications, including e.g. explicit comparisons between measurements and threshold values, and ( 3 ) implicitly associated meta-information from the database, such as the duration of exposure, the decree and the value of the threshold. This task is accomplished by a staged process that is application-oriented rather than based on linguistically motivated principles. The process starts with building some sort of a representation sketch, by instantiating a report skeleton that consists of a sequence of assertion statement specifications. Assertion statements consist of a top level predicate that represents the assertion's type (e.g. threshold-exceeding) and encapsulates the entire meaning of the associated assertion, except to attached specifications and domain data, to make local parameters and data dependencies explicit. In order to transform this initial representation to meet the application-oriented requirements of the IR, it is necessary to recast the information, which comprises augmenting, restructuring, and aggregating its components~ Augmenting statement specifications means making information implicitly contained or available elsewhere explicitly at the place it is needed. This concerns reestablishing report-wide information, as well as making locally entailed information accessible. An example for the former is the number of diagrams copied\u2022 into the introductory statement to these diagrams. This treatment is much simpler than using a reference generation algorithm, but it relies on knowing the number of diagrams in advance. An example for the latter is the unit in which the value of a measurement is expressed. Restructuring information imposes some manipulations on the specifications obtained so far to rearrange the pieces of information contained so that they meet the definition of the IR. The associated operations include reifying an attribute as a structured value and raising an embedded partial description. These operations are realized by mapping schemata similar to those elaborated for linguistically motivated lexicalization [H0racek, 1996] . However, \u2022some of our schemata are purely application-oriented and tailored to the domain, which manifests itse!f in the larger size of the structures covered. Aggregation, the last part of information recasting, comprises removing partial descriptions or adding simple structures. These operations are driven by a small set of declaratively represented rules that access a discourse memory. Most of the rules aim at avoiding repetitions of optional constituents (e.g., temporal and locative information) over adjacent statements. For example, the TIME specification is elided in the second sentence of our sample text, since the time specification in the first sentence still applies. An example for adding a simple structure to an IR expression is the insertion of a marker indicating a strong correspondence between adjacent assertions, which I i ! i l ! I i |, ! i ! sentence structure, which is accounted \u2022 for by defining alternative TGL rules with appropriate tests for the presence of some IR element. Agreement relations are encoded into TGL by virtue ofa PATR style feature percolation mechanism [Shieber et al., 1983] . The rules can be annotated by equations that either assert equality of a feature's value at two or more \u2022constituents, or introduce a feature value at a constituent. The constraint in Figure 2 requires the categories THTYPE and EXCEEDS to agree in gender, thus implementing a subject-participle agreement relation in French. This general mechanism provides a considerable amount of flexibility and goes beyond simple template filling techniques. A TGL rule is successfully applied if all actions are carried out. The rule returns the concatenation of the substrings produced by the \"template\" actions. If an action fails, backtracking can be invoked flexibly and efficiently using memoization techniques (see [Busemann, 1996] ). Costs and Benefits As Reiter and Mellish note, the use of shallow techniques needs to be justified through a cost-benefit analysis [Reiter and Mellish, 1993] . We specify the range of possible applications our approach is \u2022 useful for, exemplified by the report generator developed for the TEMSIS project. This application took an effort of about eight person months, part of which were spent implementing interfaces to the TEMSIS server and to the database, and for making ourselves acquainted with details of the domain. The remaining time was spent on (1) the elicitation of user requirements and the definition of a small text corpus, (2) the design of IR according to the domain distinctions required for the corpus texts, and (3) text organization, adaptation of TG/2 and grammar development. The grammars comprise 105 rules for the German and 122 for the French version. There are about twenty test predicates and IR access functions, most of which are needed for both languages. The French version was designed on the basis of the German one and took little more than a week to implement. The system covers a total of 384 different report structures that differ in at least one linguistic aspect. Benefits Altogether, the development effort was very low. We believe that reusing an in-depth surface generator for this task would not have scored better. Our method has a number of advantages: (1) Partial reusability. Despite its domain-dependence, parts of the system are reusable. The TG/2 interpreter has been adopted without modifications. Moreover, a sub-grammar for time expressions in the domain of appointment scheduling was reused with only minor extensions. (2) Modeling flexibility. Realization techniques of different granularity (canned text, templates, context-free grammars) allow the grammar writer to model general, linguistic knowledge as well as more specific task and domain-oriented wordings. (3) Processing \"speed. Shallow processing is fast. In our system, the average generation time of less than a second can almost be neglected (the overall run-time is longer due to database access). (4) Multi-lingual extensions. Additional languages can be included with little effort because the IR is neutral towards particular languages. (5) Variations in wording. Alternative formulations are easily integrated by defining conflicting rules in TGL. These are ordered according to a set of criteria that cause the system to prefer certain formulations to others (cf. [Busemann, 1996] ): Grammar rules leading to preferred formulations are selected first from a conflict set of concurring rules~ The preference mechanisms will be used in a future version to tailor the texts for administrative and public uses. Costs As argued above, the orientation towards the application task and domain yields some important benefits. On the other hand, there are limitations in reusability and flexibility: (1) IR cannot be reused for other applications. The consequences for the modules interfaced by IR, the text organizer and the text realizer, are a loss in generality. Since both modules keep a generic interpreter apart from partly domain-specific knowledge, the effort of transporting the components to new applications is, however, restricted to modifying the knowledge sources. (2) By associating canned text with domain acts ' TG/2 behaves in a domain and task specific way. This keeps the flexibility in the wording, which can only partly be influenced by the text organizer, inherently lower than with in-depth approaches. When does it pay off? We take it for granted that the TEMSIS generation application stands for a class of comparable tasks that can be characterized as follows. The generated texts are information-conveying reports in a technical domain. The subIanguage allows for a rather straight-forward mapping onto IR expressions, and IR expressions can be realized in a context-independent way. For these kinds of applications, our methods provide sufficient flexibility by omitting unnecessary or known information from both the schemes and its IR expressions, and by including particles to increase coherency. The reports could be generated in multiple languages. We recommend the opportunistic us e of shallow techniques for this type of application. Our approach is not suitable for tasks involving deliberate sentence planning, the careful choice of lexemes, or a sophisticated distribution of information onto linguistic units. Such tasks would not be compatible with the loose couPling of our components via IR. In addition, they would require complex tests to be formulated in TGL rules, rendering the grammar :rather obscure. Finally, if the intended coverage of content is to be kept extensibl e or is not known precisely enough at an early phase Of development, the eventual redesign of the intermediate structure and associated mapping rules for text organization may severely limit the usefulness Of our approachl Conclusion We have suggested shallow approaches to NL generation that are suited for small applications requiring limited linguistic resources. While these approaches ignore many theoretical insights gained through years of NLG research and instead revive old techniques once criticized for their lack of \u2022 flexibility, they neyertheless allow for the quick development of running systems. By integrating techniques of different granularity into one formalism, we have shown that lack of flexibility is not an inherent property of shallow approaches. Within the air quality report generation in TEMSIS, a non-trivial application was described. We also gave a qualitative evaluation of the domain characteristics to be met for our approach to work successfully. Further experience will show whether shallow techniques transpose to more complex tasks. We consider it a scientific challenge to combine shallow and in-depth approaches to analysis and generation in such a way that more theoretically motivated research finds its way into real applications.

It \u2022integrates canned text, templates, and context-free rules into a single production-rule formalism and is thus extremely well suited for coping with IR subexpressions of different granularity. TG/2 is based on production system techniques [Davis and King, 1977] that preserve the modularity of processing and linguistic knowledge. Productions are applied through the familiar threestep processing cycle: (i) identify the applicable rules, (ii) select a rule on the basis of some conflict resolution mechanism, and (iii) apply that rule. Productions are used to encode grammar rules in the language TGL [Busemann, 199611 A rule is applicable if its preconditions are met. The TGL rule in Figure 2 is applicable to input material as shown in Figure 1 , because the COOPslot matches, and there is information about the THRESHOLD-VALUE available (otherwise a different sentence pattern, and hence a different rule, would be required). TGL rules contain categories as in a context-free grammar, which are used for rule selection (see below). The rule's actions are carried out in a top-down, depth-first and left.to-right manner. They include the activation of other rules (: RULE, : 0PTRULE), the execution of a function, or the return of an ASCII string as a (partial) result. When selecting other rules by virtue of a category, the relevant portion of the input structure for which a candidate rule must pass its associated tests must be identified. The function get:parma in Figure 2 yields the substructure of the current \u2022 \u2022 input depicted by the argument. The first action selects all rules with category PPtime; the relevant substructure is the TIME slot of an IR. TGL \u2022rules are defined according to the IR syntax definitions. This includes optional IR elements, many of which can simply be omitted without disturbing fluency. In these cases, optional rules (0PTRULE) are defined in TGL. Optional actions are ignored if the input structure does not contain relevant information. In certain cases, the omission of an IR element would suggest a different",
