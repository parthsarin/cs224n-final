    "article": "This paper investigates the roles of named entities (NE's) in annotated biomedical text classification. In the annotation schema of BioCaster, a text mining system for public health protection, important concepts that reflect information about infectious diseases were conceptually analyzed with a formal ontological methodology. Concepts were classified as Types, while others were identified as being Roles. Types are specified as NE classes and Roles are integrated into NEs as attributes. We focus on the Roles of NEs by extracting and using them in different ways as features in the classifier. Experimental results show that: 1) Roles for each NE greatly helped improve performance of the system, 2) combining information about NE classes with their Roles contribute significantly to the improvement of performance. We discuss in detail the effect of each Role on the accuracy of text classification. Introduction Today, the Internet is a powerful tool for discovering novel information via news feed providers. This is becoming increasingly important for the public health domain because it can help to detect emerging and re-emerging diseases. In infectious disease surveillance systems such as the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) system (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004) and ProMed-Mail (International Society for Infectious Diseases, 2001) , the detection and tracking of outbreaks using the Internet has been proven to be a key source of information for public health workers, clinicians, and researchers interested in communicable diseases. The basis for such systems is the monitoring of a large number of news articles simultaneously. The classification of news articles into disease-related or none disease-related classes is the first stage in any automated approach to this task. In practice though there are a large number of news articles whose main subject is related to diseases but which should not necessarily be notified to users together with a relatively small number of high priority articles that experts should be actively alerted to. Alerting criteria broadly include news related to newly emerging diseases, the spread of diseases across international borders, the deliberate release of a human or engineered pathogen, etc. The use of only raw text in the classification process inevitably fails to resolve many subtle ambiguities, for example semantic class ambiguities in polysemous words like \"virus\", \"fever\", \"outbreak\", and \"control\" which all exhibit a variety of senses depending on context. These different senses appear with relatively high frequency in the news especially in headlines. A further challenge is that diseases can be denoted by many variant forms. Therefore we consider that the use of advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and anaphora resolution are needed in order to achieve high classification accuracy. Text classification is defined as the task of assigning documents into one or more predefined cat-egories. As shown by (Cohen and Hersh, 2005) , an accurate text classification system can be especially valuable to database curators. A document in the biomedical domain can be annotated using NER techniques with enriched semantic information in the form of NEs such as the disease, pathogen, location, and time. NER and term identification in general have been recognized as an important research topic both in the NLP and biomedical communities (Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004) . However, an investigation into the contribution of NEs on the performance of annotated biomedical text classification has remained an open question until now. There are two main reasons for this: Firstly there are a small number of open annotation schema for biomedical text, and secondly there is no benchmark annotated data for testing. The BioCaster project (Collier, 2006) is working towards the detection and tracking of disease outbreaks from Internet news articles. Although there are several schema for biomedical text (Wilbur et al., 2006) , little work has been done on developing one specifically for public health related text. BioCaster therefore provides an annotation schema that can fill this gap. Our schema, which is based on discussions with biologists, computational linguists and public health experts, helps identify entities related to infectious diseases which are then used to build up a detailed picture of events in later stages of text mining. One significant aspect of the schema is that it is based on conceptual analysis with a formal ontological methodology. As discussed in (Kawazoe et al., 2006) , by applying meta-properties (Guarino and Welty, 2000a; Guarino and Welty, 2000b) , our \"markable\" concepts are classified into \"Type\" and \"Role\". Information about Role concepts is integrated into the schema as attributes on NEs. This work takes the investigation one step forward by showing empirical evidence for the usefulness of Role concepts in a practical application. In this paper, we focus on the task of text classification, proceeding under the simplifying assumption that given enough annotated training data for NEs and their Roles both can be automatically tagged with high accuracy. In recent years there have been many studies on text classification using general methods (Sebastiani, 2002; Yang and Liu, 1999) semi-structured texts (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004) , and XML classification (Zaki and Aggarwal, 2003) . Other research has investigated the contribution of semantic information in the form of synonyms, syntax, etc. in text representation (Bloehdorn and Hotho, 2004; Hotho et al., 2003; Fr\u00fcrnkranz et al., 1998) . Feature selection (Scott and Matwin, 1999) has also been studied. The contribution of this paper is to provide an analysis and evaluation on the Roles of NEs in annotated text classification. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we outline the BioCaster schema for the annotation of terms in biomedical text; Section 3 presents a description of the BioCaster gold standard corpus; Section 4 provides details of the method and experimental results of classification on the gold standard corpus. Finally we draw some conclusions in Section 5. BioCaster Schema for Annotation of Terms in Biomedical Text The BioCaster annotation schema is a component of the BioCaster text mining project. We have identified several important concepts that reflect information about infectious diseases, and created guidelines for annotating them as target entity classes in texts. Based on the conceptual analysis using meta-properties (rigidity, identity, and dependency) developed by Guarino and Welty (2000a; 2000b) , categories of important concepts were classified as Types, i.e., properties which are rigid 1 and supply identity conditions, while others were identified as being Roles, properties which are anti-rigid 2 and dependent. The 18 categories of Type concepts are specified as NE classes which we denote here in upper case. These include PERSON, LOCA-TION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, DISEASE, CON-DITION (status of patient such as \"hospitalized\" or \"in stable condition\"), OUTBREAK (event of group infection), VIRUS, ANATOMY (body part), PRODUCT (biological product such as \"vaccine\"), NONHUMAN (animals), DNA, RNA, PROTEIN, CONTROL (control measures to contain the disease), BACTERIA, CHEMICAL and SYMPTOM. The three Role concepts we explore are case (dis-eased person), transmission (source of infection) and therapeutic (therapeutic agent). These are integrated into the annotation schema as XML attributes which are associated with some XML elements denoting Type concepts. PERSON takes a case attribute, NONHUMAN and ANATOMY take transmission, PRODUCT takes transmission and therapeutic and CHEMICAL takes therapeutic. For PER-SON we added another attribute number (number of people). Each attribute has only one value, the value of number is one or many, and the value of case, transmission, therapeutic is true or false. This is summarized in Table 1 . In the rest of this paper, we call case, transmission, and therapeutic \"Role attributes\" (or \"Role\" for short) and number a \"Quality attributes\" (or \"Quality\" for short). A NE in a biomedical text is annotated following the BioCaster annotation schema in XML format as follows, <NAME cl=\"Named Entity\" attribute1=\"value1\" attribute2=\"value2\" ... </NAME>, where \"Named Entity\" is one of the names for the 18 BioCaster NEs and attribute1, attribute2, ... are the names of the NE's Role/Quality attributes, \"value1\", \"value2\", ... are values corresponding to Role/Quality attributes. Further details of the annotation guidelines are discussed in (Kawazoe et al., 2006) . BioCaster Gold Standard Data Corpus The BioCaster gold standard corpus was collected from Internet news and manually annotated by two doctoral students. The annotation of a news article proceeded as follows. Firstly, NEs are annotated following the BioCaster schema and guidelines. Secondly, each annotated article is manually assigned into one of four relevancy categories: alert, publish, check, and reject. The assignment is based on guidelines that we made following discussions with epidemiologists and a survey of World Health Organization (WHO) reports (World Health Organization, 2004) . These categories are currently being used operationally by the GPHIN system which is used by the WHO and other public health agencies. Where there were major differences of opinion in NE annotation or relevancy assignment between the two an-notators, we consulted a public health expert in order to decide the most appropriate assignment. Finally we had a total of 500 articles that were fully annotated. While this is small compared to other data sets in text classification, we consider that it is large enough to obtain a preliminary indication about the usefulness of Role attributes. The following is an example of an annotated article in the BioCaster gold standard corpus. Example. <DOC id=\"000125\" language=\"en-us\" source=\"WHO\" domain=\"health\" Experiments Method We used the BioCaster gold standard corpus to investigate the effect of NE classes and their Role attributes on performance of classification. In order to avoid unnecessary data, we removed the first line containing DOC tag of all article in the corpus. The validation is as follows. We randomly divided the data set into 10 parts. Each of the first 9 parts has 23 articles belonging to the relevant category and 27 articles belonging to the reject category; the 10th part has 24 articles belonging to the relevant and 26 articles belonging to the reject categories. Then, we implemented 10-fold cross validation: 9 parts for training and 1 part for testing sets. For the training set we extracted NEs classes and their Roles as features to build a classifier. The remaining part was used for testing. The classifier we use in this paper is the standard N\u00e4ive Bayes classifier (Mitchell, 1997) . In the preprocessing we did not use a stop list and no word stemming. The experiments were implemented in Linux OS, using the Bow toolkit (McCallum, 1996) . The details of extracting NEs and their Roles from annotated texts are the followings. For the sake of convenience, we divided features into 3 groups: Features for each NE, features for NEs with Role/Quality, and features for combined NEs with Role/Quality. \"WHO\", \"has\", \"received\", \"reports\", \"of\", \"1118\", \"cases\" PERSON1 \"WHO\", \"has\", \"received\", \"reports\", \"of\", \"1118\", \"cases\", \"PERSON\" PERSON+case+number \"WHO\", \"has\", \"received\", \"reports\", \"of\", \"1118\", \"cases\", \"PERSON\", \"case\", \"number\" PERSON+case \"WHO\", \"has\", \"received\", \"reports\", \"of\", \"1118\", \"cases\", \"PERSON\", \"case\" PERSON+number \"WHO\", \"has\", \"received\", \"reports\", \"of\", \"1118\", \"cases\", \"PERSON\", \"number\" classes with Roles are used as features. In this case we have all 3 Roles case, therapeutic and transmission. An example of using different features for PER- YES is correct NO is correct Assigned YES a b Assigned NO c d Table 4: A contingency table. SON class is shown in Table 3 . Results and Discussions The details of experimental results are shown in the following sections. We use two performance measures, standard Precision/Recall and accuracy. They are calculated based on the two-way contingency table in Table 4 . In the table, a counts the assigned and correct cases, b counts the assigned and incorrect cases, c counts the not assigned but incorrect cases, and d counts the not assigned and correct cases (Yang, 1999) . Then, Precision = a a + b , and Recall = a a + c . Accuracy is defined as accuracy=(a + d)/(a + b + c + d). Effectiveness of Each NE Class In order to investigate the effect of NEs on performance, we consider the baseline as the method using text only. In experiment the baseline achieved a performance of 74.40% accuracy and 64.35% Precision, 100% Recall. We can see that Recall always achieves 100% in all cases. This may be due to the small size of data. However it is interesting that we can observe the change of Precision measure -an important measure in our case. Hereafter we discuss accuracy and Precision only. The effectiveness of each NE class is shown in Table 5. The results show that each NE does not have the same effect. Compared to the baseline, nearly half the total NEs (7/18) help improve performance while the others do not have a significant affect. Looking at the distribution of NE frequency in Table 2, it seems that the higher the frequency of the NE class, the better the performance it provides. For example, PERSON achieved the best of all (76.80% accuracy, 66.57% Precision compared to 74.40% accuracy and 64.35% Precision when using raw text). However this trend is not always followed, for example, the TIME class tends to reduce performance when compared to raw text. This is natural as there is no obvious correlation between time and relevancy. From the result tables we can conclude that the effectiveness of each NE on the performance of classification in our corpus is decreased in the following order. Effectiveness of Roles on Classification In this Section we investigate the effect of each Role on performance. The experimental results are shown in Table 6 . We can easily observe that Roles in NEs improved both the accuracy and Precision significantly. We first consider the Role case. This Role is associated to PERSON which has highest frequency in the corpus. Role case helped improve the accuracy from 76.8% to 80.60%, and Precision from 66.57% to 74.43% for PERSON. This is significant when we compare to the baseline with 74.4% accuracy and 64.35% Precision. We note that PER-SON has another attribute, the Quality number. Role case helps PERSON with Quality number improve the accuracy from 78.00% to 81.80% and Precision from 67.74% to 71.74%. Moreover, we can obviously draw the relative comparison about effectiveness between Role case and Quality number from these results, it yields that case > number. We proceed to investigate the effect of Roles therapeutic and transmission. Obviously we see that their effects on performance are positive. Specifically, transmission help NONHUMAN improve the accuracy from 74.40% to 74.60%, therapeutic helps CHEMICAL improve the accuracy from 74.20% to 74.40%. Roles on them. Interestingly, while NEs associated to Roles do not improve the accuracy like NONHU-MAN and CHEMICAL, their Roles helped improve the accuracy. Based on the improvements of transmission and therapeutic in Table 6 , we can draw their effectiveness are the same on their NEs, that is therapeutic = transmission. When we compare the effect of all Roles on performance, we can see that the improvements of Role case and also Quality number are much higher than the improvements of Roles therapeutic and transmission. We think this is because the frequency of PERSON (NE associated to Role case and Quality number) is higher than the frequency of NEs which are associated to Roles therapeutic and transmission in the corpus. Then, we can have the effect of Roles/Qualities is in the order case > number > therapeutic = transmission. Effectiveness of Combined NEs with Roles We continue to investigate the effectiveness of Roles for combined NEs. The experimental results are given in Table 7 . We note that there are two Roles therapeutic and transmission in diseaserelated NE classes, and all 3 Roles case, therapeutic and transmission in all NE classes. We can easily see that Roles improved performance of text classification significantly. In details, for disease-related NE classes, Roles therapeutic and transmission helped to improve the accuracy from 74.40% to 76.20%, and Precision from 64.35% to 66.% compared to the baseline. For all NE classes, all 3 Roles case, therapeutic, and transmission help to improve the accuracy from 74.40% to 84.40% and Precision from 64.35% to 74.76%. We conclude that all 3 Roles achieved the best results in performance. Conclusion This paper has focused on the contribution of Roles in biomedical annotated text classification. The experimental results indicated that: 1. Roles of each NE greatly help improve performance of the system. 2. The effect of Role/Quality attributes on classification was decreased in the order as follows: case > number > therapeutic = transmission. 3. Combined NE classes with Roles contribute significantly to the improvement of performance.
