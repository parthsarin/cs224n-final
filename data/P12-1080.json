We represent reranking hypotheses with several innovative kernels considering both the structure of the hierarchy and the probability of nodes. Additionally, to better investigate the role of category relationships, we consider two interesting cases: (i) traditional schemes in which node-fathers include all the documents of their child-categories; and (ii) more general schemes, in which children can include documents not belonging to their fathers. The extensive experimentation on Reuters Corpus Volume 1 shows that our rerankers inject effective structural semantic dependencies in multi-classifiers and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art. Introduction Automated Text Categorization (TC) algorithms for hierarchical taxonomies are typically based on flat schemes, e.g., one-vs.-all, which do not take topic relationships into account. This is due to two major problems: (i) complexity in introducing them in the learning algorithm and (ii) the small or no advantage that they seem to provide (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004) . We speculate that the failure of using hierarchical approaches is caused by the inherent complexity of modeling all possible topic dependencies rather than the uselessness of such relationships. More precisely, although hierarchical multi-label classifiers can exploit machine learning algorithms for structural output, e.g., (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005; Riezler and Vasserman, 2010; Lavergne et al., 2010) , they often impose a number of simplifying restrictions on some category assignments. Typically, the probability of a document d to belong to a subcategory C i of a category C is assumed to depend only on d and C, but not on other subcategories of C, or any other categories in the hierarchy. Indeed, the introduction of these long-range dependencies lead to computational intractability or more in general to the problem of how to select an effective subset of them. It is important to stress that (i) there is no theory that can suggest which are the dependencies to be included in the model and (ii) their exhaustive explicit generation (i.e., the generation of all hierarchy subparts) is computationally infeasible. In this perspective, kernel methods are a viable approach to implicitly and easily explore feature spaces encoding dependencies. Unfortunately, structural kernels, e.g., tree kernels, cannot be applied in structured output algorithms such as (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) , again for the lack of a suitable theory. In this paper, we propose to use the combination of reranking with kernel methods as a way to handle the computational and feature design issues. We first use a basic hierarchical classifier to generate a hypothesis set of limited size, and then apply reranking models. Since our rerankers are simple binary classifiers of hypothesis pairs, they can encode complex dependencies thanks to kernel methods. In particular, we used tree, sequence and linear kernels applied to structural and feature-vector representations describing hierarchical dependencies. Additionally, to better investigate the role of topical relationships, we consider two interesting cases: (i) traditional categorization schemes in which node-fathers include all the documents of their childcategories; and (ii) more general schemes, in which children can include documents not belonging to their fathers. The intuition under the above setting is that shared documents between categories create semantic links between them. Thus, if we remove common documents between father and children, we reduce the dependencies that can be captured with traditional bag-of-words representation. We carried out experiments on two entire hierarchies TOPICS (103 nodes organized in 5 levels) and INDUSTRIAL (365 nodes organized in 6 levels) of the well-known Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1). We first evaluate the accuracy as well as the efficiency of several reranking models. The results show that all our rerankers consistently and significantly improve on the traditional approaches to TC up to 10 absolute percent points. Very interestingly, the combination of structural kernels with the linear kernel applied to vectors of category probabilities further improves on reranking: such a vector provides a more effective information than the joint global probability of the reranking hypothesis. In the rest of the paper, Section 2 describes the hypothesis generation algorithm, Section 3 illustrates our reranking approach based on tree kernels, Section 4 reports on our experiments, Section 5 illustrates the related work and finally Section 6 derives the conclusions. Hierarchy classification hypotheses from binary decisions The idea of the paper is to build efficient models for hierarchical classification using global dependencies. For this purpose, we use reranking models, which encode global information. This necessitates of a set of initial hypotheses, which are typically generated by local classifiers. In our study, we used n one-vs.-all binary classifiers, associated with the n different nodes of the hierarchy. In the following sections, we describe a simple framework for hypothesis generation. Top k hypothesis generation Given n categories, C 1 , . . . , C n , we can define p 1 C i (d) and p 0 C i (d) as the probabilities that the classifier i assigns the document d to C i or not, respectively. For example, p h C i (d) can be computed from M132 M11 M12 M13 M14 M143 M142 M141 MCAT M131 Figure 1: A subhierarchy of Reuters. -M132 M11 -M12 M13 M14 M143 -M142 -M141 MCAT -M131 Figure 2 : A tree representing a category assignment hypothesis for the subhierarchy in Fig. 1 . the SVM classification output (i.e., the example margin). Typically, a large margin corresponds to high probability for d to be in the category whereas small margin indicates low probability 1 . Let us indicate with h = {h 1 , .., h n } \u2208 {0, 1} n a classification hypothesis, i.e., the set of n binary decisions for a document d. If we assume independence between the SVM scores, the most probable hypothesis on d is h = argmax h\u2208{0,1} n n i=1 p h i i (d) = argmax h\u2208{0,1} p h i (d) n i=1 . Given h, the second best hypothesis can be obtained by changing the label on the least probable classification, i.e., associated with the index j = argmin i=1,..,n p hi i (d). By storing the probability of the k \u2212 1 most probable configurations, the next k best hypotheses can be efficiently generated. Structural Kernels for Reranking Hierarchical Classification In this section we describe our hypothesis reranker. The main idea is to represent the hypotheses as a tree structure, naturally derived from the hierarchy and then to use tree kernels to encode such a structural description in a learning algorithm. For this purpose, we describe our hypothesis representation, kernel methods and the kernel-based approach to preference reranking. Encoding hypotheses in a tree Once hypotheses are generated, we need a representation from which the dependencies between the dif- ferent nodes of the hierarchy can be learned. Since we do not know in advance which are the important dependencies and not even the scope of the interaction between the different structure subparts, we rely on automatic feature engineering via structural kernels. For this paper, we consider tree-shaped hierarchies so that tree kernels, e.g. (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti, 2006a) , can be applied. In more detail, we focus on the Reuters categorization scheme. For example, Figure 1 shows a subhierarchy of the Markets (MCAT) category and its subcategories: Equity Markets (M11), Bond Markets (M12), Money Markets (M13) and Commodity Markets (M14). These also have subcategories: Interbank Markets (M131), Forex Markets (M132), Soft Commodities (M141), Metals Trading (M142) and Energy Markets (M143). As the input of our reranker, we can simply use a tree representing the hierarchy above, marking the negative assignments of the current hypothesis in the node labels with \"-\", e.g., -M142 means that the document was not classified in Metals Trading. For example, Figure 2 shows the representation of a classification hypothesis consisting in assigning the target document to the categories MCAT, M11, M13, M14 and M143. Another more compact representation is the hierarchy tree from which all the nodes associated with a negative classification decision are removed. As only a small subset of nodes of the full hierarchy will be positively classified the tree will be much smaller. Figure 3 shows the compact representation of the hypothesis in Fig. 2 . The next sections describe how to exploit these kinds of representations. Structural Kernels In kernel-based machines, both learning and classification algorithms only depend on the inner product between instances. In several cases, this can be efficiently and implicitly computed by kernel functions by exploiting the following dual formulation: i=1..l y i \u03b1 i \u03c6(o i )\u03c6(o) + b = 0, where o i and o are two objects, \u03c6 is a mapping from the objects to feature vectors x i and \u03c6(o i )\u03c6(o) = K(o i , o) is a kernel function implicitly defining such a mapping. In case of structural kernels, K determines the shape of the substructures describing the objects above. The most general kind of kernels used in NLP are string kernels, e.g. (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) , the Syntactic Tree Kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2002) and the Partial Tree Kernels (Moschitti, 2006a) . String Kernels The String Kernels (SK) that we consider count the number of subsequences shared by two strings of symbols, s 1 and s 2 . Some symbols during the matching process can be skipped. This modifies the weight associated with the target substrings as shown by the following SK equation: SK(s 1 , s 2 ) = u\u2208\u03a3 * \u03c6 u (s 1 ) \u2022 \u03c6 u (s 2 ) = u\u2208\u03a3 * I1:u=s1[ I1] I2:u=s2[ I2] \u03bb d( I1)+d( I2) where, \u03a3 * = \u221e n=0 \u03a3 n is the set of all strings, I 1 and I 2 are two sequences of indexes I = (i 1 , ..., i |u| ), with 1 \u2264 i 1 < ... < i |u| \u2264 |s|, such that u = s i 1 ..s i |u| , d( I) = i |u| \u2212 i 1 + 1 (distance between the first and last character) and \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] is a decay factor. It is worth noting that: (a) longer subsequences receive lower weights; (b) some characters can be omitted, i.e. gaps; (c) gaps determine a weight since the exponent of \u03bb is the number of characters and gaps between the first and last character; and (c) the complexity of the SK computation is O(mnp) (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) , where m and n are the lengths of the two strings, respectively and p is the length of the largest subsequence we want to consider. In our case, given a hypothesis represented as a tree like in Figure 2 , we can visit it and derive a linearization of the tree. SK applied to such a node sequence can derive useful dependencies between category nodes. For example, using the Breadth First Search on the compact representation, we get the sequence [MCAT, M11, M13, M14, M143], which generates the subsequences, [MCAT, M11], [MCAT, M11, M13, M14], [M11, M13, M143], [M11, M13, M143] and so on. M11 -M12 M13 M14 MCAT M11 -M12 M13 M14 MCAT -M132 -M131 -M132 -M131 M14 M143 -M142 -M141 M11 -M12 M13 M14 MCAT M143 -M142 -M141 M13 Tree Kernels Convolution Tree Kernels compute the number of common substructures between two trees T 1 and T 2 without explicitly considering the whole fragment space. For this purpose, let the set F = {f 1 , f 2 , . . . , f |F | } be a tree fragment space and \u03c7 i (n) be an indicator function, equal to 1 if the target f i is rooted at node n and equal to 0 otherwise. A tree-kernel function over T 1 and T 2 is T K(T 1 , T 2 ) = n 1 \u2208N T 1 n 2 \u2208N T 2 \u2206(n 1 , n 2 ), N T 1 and N T 2 are the sets of the T 1 's and T 2 's nodes, respectively and \u2206(n 1 , n 2 ) = |F | i=1 \u03c7 i (n 1 )\u03c7 i (n 2 ). The latter is equal to the number of common fragments rooted in the n 1 and n 2 nodes. The \u2206 function determines the richness of the kernel space and thus different tree kernels. Hereafter, we consider the equation to evaluate STK and PTK. 2 Syntactic Tree Kernels (STK) To compute STK, it is enough to compute \u2206 ST K (n 1 , n 2 ) as follows (recalling that since it is a syntactic tree kernels, each node can be associated with a production rule): (i) if the productions at n 1 and n 2 are different then \u2206 ST K (n 1 , n 2 ) = 0; (ii) if the productions at n 1 and n 2 are the same, and n 1 and n 2 have only leaf children then \u2206 ST K (n 1 , n 2 ) = \u03bb; and (iii) if the productions at n 1 and n 2 are the same, and n 1 and n 2 are not pre-terminals then \u2206 ST K (n 1 , n 2 ) = \u03bb l(n 1 ) j=1 (1 + \u2206 ST K (c j n 1 , c j n 2 )) , where l(n 1 ) is the number of children of n 1 and c j n is the j-th child of the node n. Note that, since the productions are the same, l(n 1 ) = l(n 2 ) and the computational complexity of STK is O(|N T 1 ||N T 2 |) but the average running time tends to be linear, i.e. O(|N T 1 | + |N T 2 |), for natural language syntactic trees (Moschitti, 2006a; Moschitti, 2006b) . Figure 4 shows the five fragments of the hypothesis in Figure 2 . Such fragments satisfy the constraint that each of their nodes includes all or none of its children. For example, [M13 [-M131 -M132]] is an STF, which has two non-terminal symbols, -M131 and -M132, as leaves while [M13 [-M131]] is not an STF. The Partial Tree Kernel (PTK) The computation of PTK is carried out by the following \u2206 P T K function: if the labels of n 1 and n 2 are different then \u2206 P T K (n 1 , n 2 ) = 0; else \u2206 P T K (n 1 , n 2 ) = \u00b5 \u03bb 2 + I1, I2,l( I1)=l( I2) \u03bb d( I 1 )+d( I 2 ) l( I1) j=1 \u2206 P T K (c n1 ( I 1j ), c n2 ( I 2j )) where d( I 1 ) = I 1l( I 1 ) \u2212 I 11 and d( I 2 ) = I 2l( I 2 ) \u2212 I 21 . This way, we penalize both larger trees and child subsequences with gaps. PTK is more general than STK as if we only consider the contribution of shared subsequences containing all children of nodes, we implement STK. The computational (Moschitti, 2006a) , where p is the largest subsequence of children that we want consider and \u03c1 is the maximal outdegree observed in the two trees. However the average running time again tends to be linear for natural language syntactic trees (Moschitti, 2006a) . complexity of PTK is O(p\u03c1 2 |N T 1 ||N T 2 |) Given a target T , PTK can generate any subset of connected nodes of T , whose edges are in T . For example, Fig. 5 shows the tree fragments from the hypothesis of Fig. 2 . Note that each fragment captures dependencies between different categories. Preference reranker When training a reranker model, the task of the machine learning algorithm is to learn to select the best candidate from a given set of hypotheses. To use SVMs for training a reranker, we applied Preference Kernel Method (Shen et al., 2003) . The reduction method from ranking tasks to binary classification is an active research area; see for instance (Balcan et al., 2008) and (Ailon and Mohri, 2010) . 10,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 10,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 Table 1 : Instance distributions of RCV1: the most populated categories are on the top, the medium sized ones follow and the smallest ones are at the bottom. There are some difference between child-free and child-full setting since for the former, from each node, we removed all the documents in its children. In the Preference Kernel approach, the reranking problem -learning to pick the correct candidate h 1 from a candidate set {h 1 , . . . , h k } -is reduced to a binary classification problem by creating pairs: positive training instances h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h 1 , h k and negative instances h 2 , h 1 , . . . , h k , h 1 . This training set can then be used to train a binary classifier. At classification time, pairs are not formed (since the correct candidate is not known); instead, the standard one-versus-all binarization method is still applied. The kernels are then engineered to implicitly represent the differences between the objects in the pairs. If we have a valid kernel K over the candidate space T , we can construct a preference kernel P K over the space of pairs T \u00d7 T as follows: P K (x, y) = P K ( x 1 , x 2 , y 1 , y 2 ) = K(x 1 , y 1 )+ K(x 2 , y 2 ) \u2212 K(x 1 , y 2 ) \u2212 K(x 2 , y 1 ), (1) where x, y \u2208 T \u00d7 T . It is easy to show (Shen et al., 2003) that P K is also a valid Mercer's kernel. This makes it possible to use kernel methods to train the reranker. We explore innovative kernels K to be used in Eq. 1: K J = p(x 1 ) \u00d7 p(y 1 ) + S, where p(\u2022) is the global joint probability of a target hypothesis and S is a structural kernel, i.e., SK, STK and PTK. tree t \u2208 T and S is again a structural kernel, i.e., SK, STK and PTK. For comparative purposes, we also use for S a linear kernel over the bag-of-labels (BOL). This is supposed to capture non-structural dependencies between the category labels. K P = x 1 \u2022 y 1 + S, Experiments The aim of the experiments is to demonstrate that our reranking approach can introduce semantic dependencies in the hierarchical classification model, which can improve accuracy. For this purpose, we show that several reranking models based on tree kernels improve the classification based on the flat one-vs.-all approach. Then, we analyze the efficiency of our models, demonstrating their applicability. Setup We used two full hierarchies, TOPICS and INDUS-TRY of Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) 3 TC cor-pus. For most experiments, we randomly selected two subsets of 10k and 5k of documents for training and testing from the total 804,414 Reuters news from TOPICS by still using all the 103 categories organized in 5 levels (hereafter SAM). The distribution of the data instances of some of the different categories in such samples can be observed in Table 1 . The training set is used for learning the binary classifiers needed to build the multiclassclassifier (MCC). To compare with previous work we also considered the Lewis' split (Lewis et al., 2004) , which includes 23,149 news for training and 781,265 for testing. Additionally, we carried out some experiments on INDUSTRY data from RCV1. This contains 352,361 news assigned to 365 categories, which are organized in 6 levels. The Lewis' split for INDUSTRY includes 9,644 news for training and 342,117 for testing. We used the above datasets with two different settings: the child-free setting, where we removed all the document belonging to the child nodes from the parent nodes, and the normal setting which we refer to as child-full. To implement the baseline model, we applied the state-of-the-art method used by (Lewis et al., 2004) for RCV1, i.e.,: SVMs with the default parameters (trade-off and cost factor = 1), linear kernel, normalized vectors, stemmed bag-of-words representation, log(T F + 1) \u00d7 IDF weighting scheme and stop list 4 . We used the LIBSVM 5 implementation, which provides a probabilistic outcome for the classification function. The classifiers are combined using the one-vs.-all approach, which is also state-of-the-art as argued in (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004) . Since the task requires us to assign multiple labels, we simply collect the decisions of the n classifiers: this constitutes our MCC baseline. Regarding the reranker, we divided the training set in two chunks of data: Train1 and Train2. The binary classifiers are trained on Train1 and tested on Train2 (and vice versa) to generate the hypotheses on Train2 (Train1). The union of the two sets constitutes the training data for the reranker. We implelibsvm/ mented two rerankers: RR, which use the representation of hypotheses described in Fig. 2 ; and FRR, i.e., fast RR, which uses the compact representation described in Fig. 3 . The rerankers are based on SVMs and the Preference Kernel (P K ) described in Sec. 1 built on top of SK, STK or PTK (see Section 3.2.2). These are applied to the tree-structured hypotheses. We trained the rerankers using SVM-light-TK 6 , which enables the use of structural kernels in SVM-light (Joachims, 1999) . This allows for applying kernels to pairs of trees and combining them with vector-based kernels. Again we use default parameters to facilitate replicability and preserve generality. The rerankers always use 8 best hypotheses. All the performance values are provided by means of Micro-and Macro-Average F1, evaluated on test data over all categories (103 or 363). Additionally, the F1 of some binary classifiers are reported. Classification Accuracy In the first experiments, we compared the different kernels using the K J combination (which exploits the joint hypothesis probability, see Sec. 3.3) on SAM. Tab. 2 shows that the baseline (state-of-theart flat model) is largely improved by all rerankers. BOL cannot capture the same dependencies as the structural kernels. In contrast, when we remove the dependencies generated by shared documents between a node and its descendants (child-free setting) BOL improves on BL. Very interestingly, TK and PTK in this setting significantly improves on SK suggesting that the hierarchical structure is more important than the sequential one. To study how much data is needed for the reranker, the figures 6 and 7 report the Micro and Macro Average F1 of our rerankers over 103 categories, according to different sets of training data. This time, K J is applied to only STK. We note that (i) a few thousands of training examples are enough to deliver most of the RR improvement; and (ii) the FRR produces similar results as standard RR. This is very interesting since, as it will be shown in the next section, the compact representation produces much faster models. Table 4 reports the F1 of some individual categories as well as global performance. In these experiments we used STK in K J and K P . We note that K P highly improves on the baseline on child-free setting by about 7.1 and 9.9 absolute percent points in Micro-and Macro-F1, respectively. Also the improvement on child-full is meaningful, i.e., 4.6 percent points. This is rather interesting as BOL (not reported in the table) achieved a Micro-average of 80.4% and a Macro-average of 57.2% when used in K P , i.e., up to 2 points below STK. This means that the use of probability vectors and combination with structural kernels is a very promising direction for reranker design. To definitely assess the benefit of our rerankers we tested them on the Lewis' split of two different datasets of RCV1, i.e., TOPIC and INDUSTRY. Table 5 shows impressive results, e.g., for INDUSTRY, the improvement is up to 5.2 percent points. We carried out statistical significance tests, which certified the significance at 99%. This was expected as the size of the Lewis' test sets is in the order of several hundreds thousands. Finally, to better understand the potential of reranking, Table 6 shows the oracle performance with respect to the increasing number of hypotheses. The outcome clearly demonstrates that there is large margin of improvement for the rerankers. Running Time To study the applicability of our rerankers, we have analyzed both the training and classification time. Figure 8 shows the minutes required to train the different models as well as to classify the test set according to data of increasing size. It can be noted that the models using the compact hypothesis representation are much faster than those using the complete hierarchy as representation, i.e., up to five times in training and eight time in testing. This is not surprising as, in the latter case, each kernel evaluation requires to perform tree kernel evaluation on trees of 103 nodes. When using the compact representation the number of nodes is upper-bounded by the maximum number of labels per documents, i.e., 6, times the depth of the hierarchy, i.e., 5 (the positive classification on the leaves is the worst case). Thus, the largest tree would contain 30 nodes. However, we only have 1.82 labels per document on average, therefore the trees have an average size of only about 9 nodes. Related Work Tree and sequence kernels have been successfully used in many NLP applications, e.g.: parse reranking and adaptation (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Shen et al., 2003; Toutanova et al., 2004; Kudo et al., 2005; Titov and Henderson, 2006) , chunking and dependency parsing (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003; Daum\u00e9 III and Marcu, 2004) , named entity recognition (Cumby and Roth, 2003 ), text categorization (Cancedda et al., 2003; Gliozzo et al., 2005) and relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2002; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006) . To our knowledge, ours is the first work exploring structural kernels for reranking hierarchical text categorization hypotheses. Additionally, there is a substantial lack of work exploring reranking for hierarchical text categorization. The work mostly related to ours is (Rousu et al., 2006) as they directly encoded global dependencies in a gradient descendent learning approach. This kind of algorithm is less efficient than ours so they could experiment with only the CCAT subhierarchy of RCV1, which only contains 34 nodes. Other relevant work such as (McCallum et al., 1998) and (Dumais and Chen, 2000) uses a rather different datasets and a different idea of dependencies based on feature distributions over the linked categories. An interesting method is SVM-struct (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) , which has been applied to model dependencies expressed as category label subsets of flat categorization schemes but no solution has been attempted for hierarchical settings. The approaches in (Finley and Joachims, 2007; Riezler and Vasserman, 2010; Lavergne et al., 2010) can surely be applied to model dependencies in a tree, however, they need that feature templates are specified in advance, thus the meaningful dependencies must be already known. In contrast, kernel methods allow for automatically generating all possible dependencies and reranking can efficiently encode them. Conclusions In this paper, we have described several models for reranking the output of an MCC based on SVMs and structural kernels, i.e., SK, STK and PTK. We have proposed a simple and efficient algorithm for hypothesis generation and their kernel-based representations. The latter are exploited by SVMs using preference kernels to automatically derive features from the hypotheses. When using tree kernels such features are tree fragments, which can encode complex semantic dependencies between categories. We tested our rerankers on the entire well-known RCV1. The results show impressive improvement on the state-of-the-art flat TC models, i.e., 3.3 absolute percent points on the Lewis' split (same setting) and up to 10 absolute points on samples using child-free setting.
