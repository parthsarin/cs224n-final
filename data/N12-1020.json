We introduce the first large-scale dependency treebank for Classical Chinese literature. Derived from the Stanford dependency types, it consists of over 32K characters drawn from a collection of poems written in the 8 th century CE. We report on the design of new dependency relations, discuss aspects of the annotation process and evaluation, and illustrate its use in a study of parallelism in Classical Chinese poetry. Introduction Recent efforts in creating linguistically annotated text corpora have overwhelmingly focused on modern languages. Among the earliest and most well-known are the part-of-speech (POS) tagged Brown Corpus (Francis & Ku\u010dera, 1982) , and the syntactically analyzed Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) . However, the first digital corpus, which emerged soon after the invention of computers, had as its subject matter a collection of 13 th -century texts ---in 1949, Roberto Busa initiated the POS tagging of the complete works of Thomas Aquinas, written in Latin. In the past decade, Humanities scholars have begun to use digital corpora for the study of ancient languages and historical texts. They come in a variety of languages and genres, from Old Eng-lish (Taylor et al., 2003) to Early New High German (Demske et al., 2004) and Medieval Portuguese (Rocio et al. 2000) ; and from poetry (Pintzuk & Leendert, 2001) to religious texts such as the New Testament (Haug & J\u00f8hndal, 2008) and the Quran (Dukes & Buckwalter, 2010) . They are increasingly being leveraged in teaching (Crane et al., 2009) and in research (Lancaster, 2010) . This paper describes the first large-scale dependency treebank for Classical Chinese. The treebank consists of poems from the Tang Dynasty (618 -907 CE), considered one of the crowning achievements in traditional Chinese literature. The first half of the paper reviews related work (section 2), then describes the design of the treebank (section 3), its text and evaluation (section 4). The second half shows the research potentials of this treebank with a study on parallelism in (section 5). Previous Work Existing linguistic resources for Chinese is predominantly for the modern language. This section first describes the major Modern Chinese treebanks on which we based our work (section 2.1), then summarizes previous research in word segmentation and POS tagging, two pre-requisites for building a Classical Chinese treebank (section 2.2). Modern Chinese Most treebanks have been annotated under one of two grammatical theories, the phrase structure grammar, which is adopted by the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) , or dependency grammar, adopted by the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic, 1998) . The most widely used treebank for Modern Chinese, the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) , belongs to the former kind. Rather than encoding constituency information, dependency grammars give information about grammatical relations between words. Modern Chinese has been analyzed in this framework, for example at Stanford University (Chang et al., 2009) . The dependency relations follow the design principles of those initially applied to English (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) , with a few added relations to accommodate Chinese-specific features, such as the \"ba\"-construction. Their POS tagset is borrowed from that of the Penn Chinese Treebank. Classical Chinese Like its modern counterpart, two pre-requisites for constructing a Classical Chinese treebank are word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. In this section, we first summarize existing POS tagging frameworks, then describe the only current treebank of Classical Chinese. Word boundaries and parts-of-speech tags have been added to the Academia Sinica Ancient Chinese Corpus (Wei et al., 1997) and the Sheffield Corpus of Chinese (Hu et al., 2005) . Since there is not yet a scholarly consensus on word segmentation in Chinese (Feng 1998), it is not surprising that there are wide-ranging levels of granularity of the POS tagsets. They range from 21 tags in (Huang et al., 2002) , 26 in the Peking University corpus (Yu et al., 2002) , 46 in the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus (Chen et al., 1996) , to 111 in the Sheffield Corpus of Chinese (Hu et al., 2005) . This treebank uses a system of nested POS tags (Lee, 2012) , which accommodates different policies for word segmentation and maximize interoperability between corpora. The only previous syntactic treebank for Classical Chinese is a constituent-based one (Huang et al., 2002) , composed of 1000 sentences from pre-Tsin Classical Chinese. No word segmentation was performed for this treebank. Treebank design Although Classical Chinese is not mutually intelligible with Modern Chinese, the two share considerable similarities in vocabulary and grammar. Given the seminal work already achieved for Mod-ern Chinese, our principle is to borrow from existing annotation framework as much as possible. For example, our POS tagset is based on that of the Penn Chinese Treebank, after a slight revision of its 33 tags (Lee, 2012) . This approach not only gives users a familiar point of reference, and also makes the treebank interoperable with existing Modern Chinese resources. Interoperability allows the potential of bootstrapping with Modern Chinese data, as well as contrastive studies for the two languages. Figure 1 . Dependency trees of two adjacent 5-character lines (forming a parallel couplet) 1 . The POS tags are based on (Xue et al., 2005) ; the dependency relations on (Chang et al., 2009) . The two lines are perfectly parallel both in terms of POS and dependencies. A dependency framework is chosen for two reasons. First, words in Classical Chinese poems, our target text (section 4), tend to have relatively free word order. Dependency grammars can handle this phenomenon well. Second, our treebank is expected to be used pedagogically, and we expect explicit grammatical relations between words to be helpful to students. These relations also encode semantic information, which lend themselves to meaning extraction applications. Our set of dependency relations is based on those developed at Stanford University for Modern Chinese (see section 2.2). Our approach is to map their 44 dependency relations, as much as possible, to Classical Chinese. Modern Chinese, a noninflectional language, does not mark many linguistic features, including person, gender, and number, etc. It uses a small number of function words to encode other features, such as tense, voice, and case. Many of these function words do not exist in Classical Chinese. In particular, prepositions are rare 2 ; instead, nouns expressing time, locations, instruments, indirect recipients, etc., modify the verb directly. This phenomenon prompted the introduction of two new relations \"locative modifiers\" (section 3.1) and \"oblique objects\" (section 3.2); and the re-instatement of two relations, \"noun phrases as adverbial modifiers\" (section 3.3) and \"indirect objects\", from the Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) that are excluded from the Modern Chinese variant (Chang et al., 2009 ) . An overview is provided in Table 1 . (Chang et al., 2009) . All other relations from Stanford Modern Chinese are retained and are not listed here. Locative modifiers To indicate time, English usually requires a preposition (e.g., 'on Monday'), but sometimes does not 2 Classical Chinese has a category of verbs called \"coverbs\" which function like prepositions, but are less frequently used. (Pulleyblank, 1995) . (e.g., 'today'). For the latter case, the bare noun phrase is considered a \"temporal modifier\" in a tmod relation with the verb in (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) . Similarly, to indicate locations, a preposition is normally required in English (e.g., 'on the hill'). However, in Classical Chinese, the preposition is frequently omitted, with the bare locative noun phrase modifying the verb directly. To mark these nouns, we created the \"locative modifier\" relation (lmod). Consider sentence (1) in Table 2 . Although the word \"hill\" occupies the position normally reserved for the subject, it actually indicates a location, and is therefore assigned the lmod relation. In sentence (2), the locative noun 'alley' is placed after the verb. Oblique objects Oblique objects are a well-known category in the analysis of ancient Indo-European languages, for example Latin and ancient Greek. In the PROIEL treebank (Haug and J\u00f8hndal, 2008) , for example, the \"oblique\" (obl) relation marks arguments of the verb which are not subjects or non-accusative 'objects'. These are most commonly nouns in the dative or ablative case, as well as prepositional phrases. It is believed that oblique objects exist in Classical Chinese, but have been replaced by prepositional phrases in Modern Chinese (Li and Li, 1986) . The obl relation is imported to our treebank to mark nouns that directly modify a verb to express means, instrument, and respect, similar to the functions of datives and ablatives. They typically come after the verb. In sentence (6) in Table 2 , the noun 'cup' is used in an instrumental sense to modify 'drunk' in an obl relation. Noun phrase as adverbial modifier A temporal modifier such as \"today\" is an example where a noun phrase serves as an adverbial modifier in English. This usage is more general and extends to other categories such as floating reflexives (e.g., it is itself adequate), and other PP-like NPs (e.g., two times a day). These noun phrases are marked with the relation npadvmod in (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) . Dependency Stanford English \u221a \u221a Oblique objects (obl) \u221a Concessive, temporal, conditional, and causal modifier (conc, temp, cond, caus) \u221a Table 2 . Example sentences illustrating the use of the dependency relations lmod (locative modifier), iobj (indirect object), npadvmod (noun phrase as adverbial modifier), and obl (oblique object) 3 . In Modern Chinese, this usage is less frequent 4 , perhaps leading to its exclusion in (Chang et al., 2009) . In contrast, in Classical Chinese, nouns function much more frequently in this capacity, expressing metaphoric meaning, reasons, moods, 3 The verses are from Wang Wei \u300a\u9001\u6893\u5dde\u674e\u4f7f\u541b\u300b, \u300a\u912d\u679c \u5dde\u76f8\u904e\u300b; Meng Haoran \u300a\u540c\u5f35\u660e\u5e9c\u6e05\u93e1\u6b4c\u300b, \u300a\u5bb4\u5305\u4e8c\u878d \u5b85\u300b, \u300a\u8207\u767d\u660e\u5e9c\u6e38\u6c5f\u300b,\u300a\u548c\u8cc8\u4e3b\u7c3f\u5f01\u4e5d\u65e5\u767b\u5cf4\u5c71\u300b. 4 Mostly restricted to temporal and location modifiers. repetitions, etc., and typically preceding the verb (Li and Li, 1986) . Sentences (4) and ( 5 ) in Table 2 provide examples of this kind, with the noun 'self' as a reflexive, and the noun 'year' indicating repetition. Indirect objects The double object construction contains two objects in a verb phrase. The direct object is the thing or person that is being transferred or moved (e.g., \"he gave me a book\"); the indirect object is the recipient (\"he gave me a book\"). In inflected languages, the noun representing the indirect object may be marked by case. Since Classical Chinese does not have this linguistic device, the indirect object is unmarked; we distinguish it with the \"indirect object\" label (iobj). The iobj label exists in Stanford English dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), but was not included in the Modern Chinese version (Chang et al., 2009) , likely due to its infrequent appearance in Modern Chinese. It is re-instated in our Classical Chinese treebank. Sentence (3) in Table 2 provides an example, with 'word' as the direct object and 'person' as the indirect. Absence of copular verbs In a copular construction such as \"A is B\", A is considered the \"topic\" (top) of the copular verb \"is\" (Chang et al., 2009) . The copular, however, is rarely used in Classical Chinese (Pulleyblank, 1995) . In some cases, it is replaced by an adverb that functions as a copular verb. If so, that adverb is POS-tagged as such (VC) in our treebank, and the dependency tree structure is otherwise normal. In other cases, the copular is absent altogether. Rather than inserting implicit nodes as in (Haug and J\u00f8hndal, 2008) , we expand the usage of the top relation. It usually connects the subject (\"A\") to the copular, but would in this case connect it with the noun predicate (\"B\") instead. In the example sentence below, the relation top('capable', 'general') would be assigned. Discourse relations Two clauses may be connected by a discourse relation, such as causal or temporal. In English, these relations may be explicitly realized, most commonly by discourse connectives, such as 'because' or 'when'. Even in the absence of these connectives, however, two adjacent clauses can still hold an implicit discourse relation. A detailed study, which resulted in the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008) , found that explicit relations outnumber implicit ones in English, but the latter is nonetheless quite common and can be annotated with high inter-annotator agreement. In many ancient languages, explicit realization of discourse relations is less frequent. In Latin and Ancient Greek, for instance, these connectives are often replaced by a participial clause. The participle is marked only by the genitive or ablative case, leaving the reader to decide from context how it relates to the main clause. As a non-inflectional language, Classical Chinese cannot use this device, and instead typically constructs a complex sentence with a series of verbs without any marking (Pulleyblank, 1995) . For example, sentence (2) in Table 3 literally says 'not capable, good ruler forsake'; the onus is put on the reader to interpret the first two characters to form a clause that provides the reason for the rest of the line. This condensed style of expression often erects a barrier for understanding. Although the focus of the treebank is on syntax rather than discourse, we decided to annotate these relations. Implicit connectives are more difficult to achieve interannotator agreement (Prasad et al., 2008) ; since they are mostly implicit in Classical Chinese, we adopted a coarse-grained classification system, rather than the hierarchical system of sense tags in the Penn Discourse Treebank. More precisely, it contains only the four categories posited by (Wang, 2003 ) ---causal, concessive, temporal, and conditional. Table 3 gives some examples. When it is impossible to determine the discourse relation between two lines, the default \"dependent\" (dep) label is assigned. This label is originally used when \"the system is unable to determine a more precise dependency relation between two words\" (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). Data Among the various literary genres, poetry enjoys perhaps the most elevated status in the Classical Chinese tradition. The Tang Dynasty is considered the golden age of shi, one of the five subgenres of Chinese poetry 7 . The Complete Shi Poetry of the Tang (Peng, 1960) , originally compiled in 1705, consists of nearly 50,000 poems by more than two thousand poets. This book is treasured by scholars and the public alike. Even today, Chinese people informally compose couplets (see section 5), in the style of shi poetry, to celebrate special occasions such as birthdays. Indeed, NLP techniques have been applied to generate them automatically (Jiang and Zhou, 2008) . Material This treebank contains the complete works, a total of over 32,000 characters in 521 poems, by two Chinese poets in the 8 th century CE, Wang Wei and Meng Haoran. Wang, also known as the Poet-Buddha (shifo \u8a69\u4f5b), is considered one of the three most prominent Tang poets. Meng is often asso- 7 The other four genres are ci, fu, qu, and sao. (3) [Although] the country is broken, the mountains and the rivers still stay. dep-conc('exist', 'broken') ciated with Wang due to the similarity of his poems in style and content. Aside from the dependency relations, word boundaries and POS tags, the treebank contains a number of metadata. For each character, the tone is noted as either level (ping \u5e73) or oblique (ze \u4ec4). Each poem is also recorded for its title, author, and genre, which may be 'recent-style' (jintishi \u8fd1\u9ad4\u8a69 ) or 'ancient-style' (gutishi \u53e4\u9ad4\u8a69). This choice of our text stems from three motivations. Classical Chinese is typically written in a compressed style, especially so with poetry, where the word order is relatively flexible, and grammatical exceptions are frequent. These characteristics pose a formidable challenge for students of Classical Chinese, for whom Tang poetry often forms part of the introductory material. It is hoped that this treebank will serve a pedagogical purpose. Second, this challenging text makes it more likely that the resulting dependency framework can successfully handle other Classical Chinese texts. Third, Tang poetry is an active area of research in Chinese philology, and we aspire to contribute to their endeavor. Inter-annotator agreement Two annotators, both university graduates with a degree in Chinese, created this treebank. To measure inter-annotator agreement, we set apart a subset of about 1050 characters, on which both of them independently perform three tasks: POS tagging, head selection, and dependency labeling. Their agreement rate is 95.1%, 92.3%, and 91.2% for the three respective tasks. For POS tagging, the three main error categories are the confusion between adverbs (AD) and verbs with an adverbial force, between measure words (M) and nouns (NN), and between adjectives (JJ) and nouns. The interested reader is referred to (Lee, 2012) for a detailed analysis. These differences in POS tags trickle down to head selection and dependency labeling. In fact, all words which received different POS tags also received different dependency relations. To illustrate with a disagreement between adverb and verb, consider the following sentence. The word \u6050 kong 'afraid' may be considered as an adverb, expressing the psychological state for the verb 'attract'; or, alternatively, as a verb in its own right. Depending on the decision, it bears either the relation advmod or root. \u6050 \u62db \u8ca0 \u6642 \u7d2f 'afraid' 'attract' 'burden' 'fame' 'affect' [I am] afraid [I] will attract and be burdened by fame 8 . Some differences are genuine alternative annotations, resulting from a mixture of polysemy and flexible word order. Consider the sentence \u7c1e\u98df\u4f0a \u4f55 dan shi yi he, consisting of four characters meaning, in order, 'bowl / blanket', 'food', a copular or a particle, and 'what'. If the meaning 'bowl' and copular is taken, it means 'What food is contained in that bowl?' In this case, the relation clf is required for \u7c1e dan, and \u4f0a yi is the root word. Alternatively, if the meaning 'blanket' and particle is taken, it is interpreted as 'What food is placed on the blanket?' Here, dan takes on the relation nn, and the root word would be \u4f55 he instead. Application: Parallel Couplets We now demonstrate one use of this treebank by analyzing a well-known but understudied feature of Classical Chinese poetry: the parallel couplets. Introduction Parallelism in poetry refers to the correspondence of one line with another; the two lines may bear similar or opposite meaning, and have comparable grammatical constructions. This phenomenon is perhaps most well known in classical Hebrew poetry, but it is also one of the defining features of Chinese poetry; \"it pervades their poetry universally, forms its chief characteristic feature, and is the source of a great deal of its artificial beauty\", observed Sir John Francis Davis, author of one of the earliest commentaries on Chinese poetry published in the West (Davis 1969) . The lines in a Chinese poem almost always contain the same number of characters, most commonly either five or seven characters. This exact equality of the number of characters makes it especially suited for expressing parallelism, which became a common feature ever since 'recent-style' poetry (section 4.1) was developed during the Tang Dynasty. Unlike those in 'ancient-style', poems of this style are tonally regulated and assume a high degree of parallelism within a couplet, i.e., two adjacent lines. See Figure 1 for an example. Methodology The couplet in Figure 1 is undisputedly symmetric, both in terms of POS tags and dependency labels. The definition for parallelism is, however, quite loose; in general, the corresponding characters must 'agree' in part-of-speech and have related meaning. These are unavoidably subjective notions. While a vast amount of Tang poems have been digitized, they have not been POS-tagged or syntactically analyzed in any significant amount. It is not surprising, therefore, that no large-scale, empirical study on how, and how often, the characters 'agree'. There have been a study on 1,000 couplets (Cao, 1998) , and another on a small subset of the poems of Du Mu (Huang, 2006) , but neither clarify the criteria for parallelism. We undertake a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, approach, using only the treebank data as the basis. Character-level parallelism. Even given the POS tags, this study is not straightforward. The naive metric of requiring exactly matched POS tags yields a parallel rate of only 74% in the corpus as a whole. This figure can be misleading, because it would vary according to the granularity of the POS tagset: the more fine-grained it is, the less agreement there would be. As a metric for parallelism, it has high precision but lower recall, and would only be appropriate for certain applications such as couplet generation (Jiang and Zhou, 2008) . By examining portions of the regulated verse where parallelism is expected, we derived five 'equivalence sets' of POS tags, shown in Table 4 . Two tags in the same set are considered parallel, even though they do not match. In many sets, a tag needs to be qualified with its dependency relations, since it is considered parallel to other members in the set only when it plays certain syntactic roles. When applying these equivalence sets as well as exact matching, the parallel rate increases to 87%. Equivalence POS tags and dependency links The algorithm is of course not perfect 9 . It cannot detect, for example, parallelism involving the use of a polysemous character with a 'out-ofcontext' meaning (jieyi \u501f\u7fa9). For instance, the character \u8005 zhe, the fourth character in the second line in the couplet 10 \"\u6b32\u5c31\u7d42\u7109\u5fd7\uff0c\u606d\u805e\u667a\u8005\u540d,\" means 'person'. On the surface, it does not match its counterpart, \u7109 yan, the fourth character in the first line, since yan is a sentence particle and zhe is a noun. However, the poet apparently viewed them as parallel, because zhe can also function as a sentence particle in other contexts. Phrase-level parallelism. The character-level metric, however, still rejects some couplets that would be deemed parallel by scholars. Most of these couplets are parallel not at the character level, but at the phrase level. A line in a 'recent-style' poem is almost always segmented into two syntactic units (Cai, 1998) . A pentasyllabic (5-character) line is composed of a disyllabic unit (the first two characters) followed by a trisyllabic unit (the last three characters) 11 . Consider two corresponding disyllabic units, \u62b1\u7434 bao qin 'hold' 'violin', and \u5782\u91e3 sui diao 'look down' 'fish'. They are tagged as bao/VV qin/NN and sui/AD diao/VV, respectively. There is a complete mismatch at the character level: bao is a verb but sui is an adverb; qin is a noun but diao is a verb. Taken as a whole, however, both units are verb phrases describing an activity ('to hold a violin' and 'to fish while looking down'), and so the poet likely considered them to be parallel at the unit, or phrase, level. The dependencies provide a convenient way to gauge the level of parallelism at the phrase level. One can extract the head word in the corresponding units in the couplet (bao/VV and diao/VV in the example above), then compare their POS tags, using the algorithm for character-level parallelism describe above. Results The results are shown in Table 5 . All couplets from an 'ancient-style' poem are considered \"parallelism optional\". A couplet from a 'recent-style' poem with eight or more lines 12 is either \"parallelism not expected\", if it is the first or last couplet in the poem; or \"parallelism expected\", if it is in the middle of the poem. We first determine whether a character is parallel to its counterpart in the couplet at the character level; if not, then we back off to the phrase level. In the \"parallelism expected\" category, the couplets of Wang are highly parallel, at both the character (91%) and phrase levels (95%). This is hardly surprising, given that his poems are highly regarded. It is notable, however, that the proportion is still relatively high (57% at the character level) even among those couplets for which parallelism is not expected, suggesting that the poet placed a high view on parallelism. He also employed much parallelism (64% at the character level) in 'ancient-style' poems, perhaps to aim at a higher artistic effect. Among the couplets of Wang which are not parallel at the phrase level, the most frequent combination is a verb phrase matching a noun phrase. The verb, as the second character, is modified by an adverb; the noun, also as the second character, is modified by an adjective. This implies that the \"AD VV\" vs. \"JJ NN\" combination may be considered to be parallel by poets at the time. The trends for Meng are similar, with a significantly higher score for couplets expected to be parallel than those that are not (82% vs. 53% at the character level). Compared to Wang, however, both percentages are lower. One wonders if this has any correlation with Meng being commonly considered a less accomplished poet. Since the 'rules' for parallelism have never been codified, 12 These are known as the 'regulated verse' (lushi \u5f8b\u8a69) and are subject to definite patterns of parallelism. Those with fewer lines are left out, since their patterns are less regular. Meng may also have simply espoused a more coarse-grained view of parts-of-speech. This hypothesis would be consistent with the fact that, at the phrase level, the proportion of parallelism for Meng is much closer to that for Wang. This suggests that Meng was content with parallelism at the phrase level and emphasized less on matching character to character. Table 5 . The proportion of characters that are parallel to their counterparts in the couplet (see section 5.2). The couplets are classified into three types, depending on the genre of poetry and their position in the poem (see section 5.3). Conclusion We have presented the first large-scale dependency treebank of Classical Chinese literature, which encodes works by two poets in the Tang Dynasty. We have described how the dependency grammar framework has been derived from existing treebanks for Modern Chinese, and shown a high level of inter-annotator agreement. Finally, we have illustrated the utility of the treebank with a study on parallelism in Classical Chinese poetry. Future work will focus on parsing Classical Chinese poems of other poets, and on enriching the corpus with semantic information, which would facilitate not only deeper study of parallelism but also other topics such as imagery and metaphorical coherence (Zhu and Cui, 2010) .
