We applied the C2P index to noun predominance using cross-lingual child communicative development inventory databases and confirmed that it indicates noun predominance in word learning, suggesting that the process between a word's comprehension and its production is a significant factor of predominance in noun learning by children. Introduction At around one year of age, infants produce their first words and rapidly start acquiring more of them. Almost every child follows this tendency. However, the content of a child's first few words depends on the individual. These variances might reflect different culture, language, and individual environments. In the children word learning process, identifying what parts of speech children learn first is important; this result would be a step toward resolving the children's word acquiring mechanism and would provide clues for engineering solutions for teaching words to computers. Gentner argued that nouns should predominate verbs since they appear more often than verbs in the early development stages of children (Gentner, 1979; Gentner et al., 2001) . There are two hypotheses for this predominance: the existence of a word continuum and constraints (biases). Gentner explained the former hypothesis using a division of dominance continuum. She assumed a word continuum in abstract space that varies from cognitive to linguistic dominance and introduced two assumptions, natural partitions and relational relativity, to explain that children learn words in the cognitive dominance region earlier than words in the linguistic dominance region. Since the natural partitions insist that concrete objects and entities are easier to individuate in the world, children easily acquire nouns. Relational relativity insists that a verb's meaning is not isolated and that it depends on the surrounding words. Maguire et al. explained similar reasons for noun predominance using the shape, individuation, concreteness, and imageability (SICI) continuum (Maguire et al., 2006) . These factors are assigned to the one dimensional abstract space axis (from left to right). The instances of words are arranged on the axis where the far left instance has an easy shape, simple individuation, high concreteness, and high imageability. Considering the meaning of nouns and verbs, we can allocate nouns to the left hand side and verbs to the right hand side. The SICI continuum has distributions of nouns and verbs that describe their individual difficulty differences. However, no direct evidence has connected the concrete measure of word difficulty to abstract spaces because no index, other than the occurrence rate of the part of speech, has expressed word difficulty. Since the occurrence rate is strongly affected by such environments as culture and parent input, measuring word difficulty is not appropriate. This assumption, that noun acquisition predominates verb acquisition, remains controversial (Benedict, 1979; Tardif, 1996) . This paper defines a concrete measure to evaluate noun predominance in word learning. We apply this measure to evaluate noun predominance using a cross-lingual child word development database. We also discuss the reason underlying noun predominance. Crosslingual CDI databases The MacA rthur Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) (Dale et al., 1996) , which are based on parent reports, are used to check when children comprehend and produce a particular word. Mothers of children of a certain age or less complete the Words and Gestures (WG) CDI form, and mothers of children over a particular age by months fill out the Words and Sentences (WS) form. WG has two columns that verify whether the toddler understands or understands/says a particular word. Checking the \"understand\" column means that the child completely comprehends the word. Checking the \"understand/say\" column means that the child has produced the word. WS has only one column to verify whether a child can say a particular word. Checking this column means that the child has produced that word. Even though CDI was originally develped for English (Dale et al., 1996) , it has recently been adapted to other languages to provide research resources, and cross-lingual CDI databases are now available. The next sub-section describes the databases we used. American, Spanish and Danish CDI databases We use American (Dale et al., 1996) , Mexican Spanish (Dale et al., 1996 ), Danish (Madsen, 2008) database in the Lex 2005 CDI database (J\u00f8rgensen, et al., 2010) American inventory for WG has 396 words. The comprehension and production norms are calculated from inventory result for children from 8 to 16 month ages. American inventory for WS has 680 words for children from 16 to 30 month ages. Mexican Spanish inventory for WS has 427 words. The comprehension and production norms are calculated from inventory result for children from 8 to 18 month ages. Mexican Spanish inventory for WS has 681 words for children from 16 to 30 month ages. Japanese CDI database We collected cross-sectional data from 1,852 mothers living in Nara, Osaka, and Kyoto with 10~32 month-old children, and these women performed the Japanese version of CDI at our laboratories over about six years from April, 2006. The Japanese inventory for WG has 448 words for 10 to 22 months. WS has 711words for 20 to 32 month-old children.. (Frank et al., 2016) : Croatian (Kovacevic, Babic, Brozovic, 1996) , French (Quebec) (Trudeau, Sutton, 2011) , Italian (Caselli, Casadio, Bates, 1999) , Korean, Latvian, and Norwegian (Simonsen, Kristoffersen, Bleses, Wehberg, J\u00f8rgensen, 2014) , and Slovak and Turkish (Ay, 2009) . The data were downloaded on 9/17/17.2.4 Number of children for each language database The number of children for each language is shown in Table 1 . Fitting the acquisition curves by logistic functions By monthly categorizing the obtained CDI data, we calculated the acquisition rates of children who comprehend and produce a particular word every month. Here the rates, which were calculated from insufficient data, were treated as missing values. Then we modeled these curves using logistic functions with respect to age in days: ( ) 1 + + = + cx b cx b ae f x e , (1) ( ) 1 + + = + c'x b' c'x b' a'e f' x e , (2) where f and f' are the logistic functions for word comprehension and word production. First, Eq. ( 1 ) is calculated by the nonlinear least mean square method to fit the rates of infants who produce a word. Here we introduce a constraint where the probability must be one or less. To satisfy this constraint, if a is bigger than 1.0, it is set to 1.0, and then b and c are recalculated by the nonlinear least mean square method. Next we calculated Eq. 2. However, we found that for some words, the comprehension acquisition rates were not appropriately calculated since we didn't have as much data for these words as for the word production data. This lack of data was caused by the difficulty that mothers verify the their children's vocabulary after their children comprehend a large number of words. Thus we set constraint f(x)\u2264f'(x) under which a', b', and c' should be obtained. However, simultaneously obtaining a', b', c', a, b, and c under the constraint is mathematically difficult. Therefore instead of that complicated constraint, we introduce a simple constraint, a\u2264a', in the following optimizing method: To estimate correctly the production rate, we introduce a constraint where the word comprehension rate should exceed the word production rate. a', b' and c' are obtained by the non-linear least mean square method ; if a>a', a' is fixed to a, and then b' and c' are recalculated by non linear least mean square method. If a' > 1.0, a' is fixed to 1.0, and then b and c are recalculated. Fig. 1 shows an example of estimated logistic functions for the acquisition rates of kondo (next time). These approximations work well for the acquisition and word production rates. An example of this situation is shown in Fig. 1 , where the dotted line is the comprehension rate curve. The solid line in Fig. 1 shows the obtained production rate. Word comprehension-to-production index The ratio of the parts of speech produced within a certain period sequence was previously used to investigate which part of speech predominates. One problem with such ratios is that since they can only be obtained for parts of speech, they cannot determine which word is difficult by a word-by-word examination. Because of this, the rate is strongly affected by such environments as culture and parent input To evaluate word difficulty in such a word-by-word fashion, we used the word comprehension day, the word production day, and the period between them. We call this period the comprehension-to-production (C2P) index. Although some might think that it only evaluates a partial learning process of children, it is important to subdivide the learning process and investigate each part of it to precisely understand the entire learning process. To calculate this index, we first define the word comprehension and production days as when 50% of the children respectively comprehend and produce a particular word. These days were determined by approximating the word comprehension and production rate curves by two logistic functions, setting the functions to 0.5, and solving them by the Newton method. Fig. 1 shows an example of the C2P index for kondo (next time). Investigation of noun predominance for word acquisition days and periods We used the American database to investigate which indexes are good measures to evaluate noun predominance: the comprehension days, the production days, or the C2P indexes. To classify the words into nouns and verbs, we used Caselli's part-of-speech classification (Caselli et al.) and calculated the comprehension days, the production days, and the C2P indexes for the words except those whose C2P indexes couldn't be calculated. Fig. 2 shows the noun and verb distributions for the comprehension days for the American database. The average number of comprehension days for verbs was 480, and for nouns it was 498, showing a small difference in the number of days between them (p <0.2). In terms of the comprehension days, nouns do not predominate verbs. Fig. 3 shows the noun and verb distributions for the American database for the word production days. The average for verbs was 731 days, and for nouns it was 681 days, showing significant differences in the number of days (p <0.001). Nouns predominate verbs in terms of word production days. Considering the process of word acquisition, the word production day can be divided into two processes: the comprehension process and the process for the C2P index. From Fig. 2 we confirmed that word comprehension days do not contribute to noun predominance, suggesting that the C2P index period primarily contributes to noun predominance. Fig. 4 shows the noun and verb distributions for the American database for the C2P index. The average C2P index of verbs was 251 days, and for nouns it was 183 days, showing significant differences in the number of days (p <0.001). This result shows that in the periods between the comprehension and production days, nouns  strongly predominate verbs. The process from word comprehension to word production strongly affects noun predominance in word-learning. Fig. 5 , Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show the noun and verb distributions for the Danish database for the comprehension day, the production day, and the C2P index. These results resemble those of the American database and also show that the process from word comprehension to word production strongly affects noun predominance in word-learning. We calculated the comprehension days, the production days, and the C2P indexes for all of these languages to investigate the generality of this result using the cross-lingual database described in Section 2. Tables 1, 2 , and 3 show the comprehension days, the production days, and the C2P indexes of nouns and verbs for the target languages. We also evaluated the value differences between nouns and verbs using a t-test. The results show noun predominance in the C2P indexes among all the languages except for Slovak and Turkish. This result suggests that the process between a word's comprehension and its production is a significant factor of predominance in noun learning by children and strongly supports the Gentner relational relativity hypothesis, because, to produce a verb, the surrounding words must be understood. The C2P index is a good measure to evaluate this factor because we confirmed that it evaluates the word acquisition difficulty of individual verbs and indicates that investigation of the C2P index of verbs might reveal the infant acquisition process of syntax.   Table 4 shows that C2P is also a good measure to examine language characteristics. Conclusion This paper defines a comprehension-to-production (C2P) index that measures the difficulty of a partial word learning process from comprehension to production to investigate whether nouns have pre dominance over verbs in word learning by children. We evaluated C2P indexes for cross-languages using crosslingual CDI databases and confirmed that they indicate noun predominance in word learning and that the process between a word's comprehension and its production is a significant factor of predominance in noun learning by children. The experiment in this paper strongly supports the Gentner relational relativity hypothesis and argues that C2P is also a good measure to examine verb and language characteristics.
