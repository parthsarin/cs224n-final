There have been succesfuld experiments in combining machine learning and ontologies, or light-weight ontologies such as WordNet, for word sense disambiguation. However, what we are trying to do, is to disambiguate complex concepts consisting of two simpler concepts and the relation that holds between them. The motivation behind the approach is to expand existing methods for content based information retrieval. The experiments have been performed using an annotated extract of a corpus, consisting of prepositions surrounded by noun phrases, where the prepositions denote the relation we are trying disambiguate. The results show an unexploited opportunity of including prepositions and the relations they denote, e.g. in content based information retrieval. Introduction What we describe in this paper, which we refer to as relation disambiguation, is in some sense similar to word sense disambiguation. In traditional word sense disambiguation the objective is to associate a distinguishable sense with a given word (Ide and V\u00e9ronis, 1998) . It is not a novel idea to use machine learning in connection with traditional word sense disambiguation, and as such it is not a novel idea to include some kind of generalization of the concept that a word expresses in the learning task either (Yarowsky, 1992) . Other projects have used light-weight ontologies such as WordNet in this kind of learning task (Voorhees, 1993; Agirre and Martinez, 2001) . What we believe is our contribution with this work is the fact that we attempt to learn complex concepts that consist of two simpler concepts, and the relation that holds between them. Thus, we start out with the knowledge that some relation holds between two concepts, which we could express as REL(concept1, concept2) , and what we aim at being able to do is to fill in a more specific relation type than the generic REL, and get e.g. POF(concept1, concept2) in the case where a preposition expresses a partitive relation. This makes it e.g. possible to determine from the sentence \"France is in Europe\" that France is a part of Europe. As in word sense disambiguation we here presuppose a finite and minimal set of relations, which is described in greater detail in section 2. The ability to identify these complex structures in text, can facilitate a more content based information retrieval as opposed to more traditional search engines, where the information retrieval relies more or less exclusively on keyword recognition. In the OntoQuery project 1 , pertinent text segments are retrieved based on the conceptual content of the search phrase as well as the text segments (Andreasen et al., 2002; Andreasen et al., 2004) . Concepts are here identified through their corresponding surface form (noun phrases), and mapped into the ontology. As a result, we come from a flat structure in a text to a graph structure, which describes the concepts that are referred to in a given text segment, in relation to each other. However, at the moment the ontology is strictly a subsumption-based hierarchy and, further, only relatively simple noun phrases are recognized and mapped into the ontology. The work presented here expands this scope by including other semantic relations between noun phrases. Our first experiments in this direction have been an analysis of prepositions with surrounding noun phrases (NPs). Our aim is to show that there is an affinity between the ontological types of the NP-heads and the relation that the preposition denotes, which can be used to represent the text as a complex semantic structure, as opposed to simply running text. The approach to showing this has been to annotate a corpus and use standard machine learning methods on this corpus. Semantic relations The following account is based on the work of (Jensen and Nilsson, 2006) : Relations exist between entities referred to in discourse. They can exist at different syntactic levels; across sentence boundaries as in example 1, or within a sentence, a phrase or a word. The relations can be denoted by different parts of speech, such as a verb, a preposition or an adjective, or they can be implicitly present in compounds and genitive constructions as in example 2. Semantic relations are n-ary: In example 1 below the verb form 'owns' denotes a binary relation between Peter and a dog, and in example 3, the verb form 'gave' denotes a ternary relation between Peter, the dog and a bone. In example 4 the preposition 'in' denotes a binary relation between the dog and the yard. (1) Peter owns a dog. It is a German shepherd. (2) Peter's dog. (3) Peter gave the dog a bone. (4) The dog in the yard. In the framework of this machine learning project, we will only consider binary relations denoted by prepositions. A preposition, however, can be ambiguous in regard to which relation it denotes. As an example, let us consider the Danish preposition i (Eng: in): The surface form i in 'A i B' can denote at least five different relations between A and B: As presented above, the idea is to perform supervised machine learning, that will take into account the surface form of the preposition and the ontological type of the heads of the surrounding noun phrases, and on this basis be able to determine the relation that holds between noun phrases surrounding a preposition in unseen text. 1. A patient The corpus In order to establish a training set, a small corpus of approximately 18,500 running words has been compiled from texts from the domain of nutrition and afterwards annotated with the ontological type of the head of the noun phrases, and the semantic relation denoted by the preposition 2 . All the text samples in this corpus derive from \"The Danish National Encyclopedia\" (Gyldendal, 2004) , and are thus not only limited domain-wise, but also of a very specific text type which can be classified as expertto-non-expert. Thus, we cannot be certain that our results can be directly transferred to a larger or more general domain, or to a different text type. This aspect would have to be empirically determined. Annotation For the purpose of learning relations, 952 excerpts of the form: N P \u2212 P \u2212 N P (5) have been extracted from the corpus and annotated with information about part of speech, ontological type and relation type for NP heads and prepositions, respectively. An example of the analyzed text excerpts are given in table 1 on the following page, where each row indicates a level of the analysis. The POS-tagging and head extraction have been done automatically, the ontological type assignation partly automatically (ontology look-up) and partly manually (for words that do not exist as instantiations of concepts in the ontology). The relation annotation has been done manually. The tags used in the annotation on the three levels are: POS-tags. Our tagger uses a subset of the PAROLE tag set, consisting of 43 tags, see (Hansen, 2000) , which means that it is a low level POS tagging with little morphosyntactic information. We only use the tags in order to extract NPs and prepositions, and thus do not need a more fine-grained information level. Secondly, it can be due to conceptual, lexical or syntactic ambiguity in the utterance. We cannot remove these sources of disagreement, but we can introduce tools that make the annotation more consistent. By using a finite and minimal realtion tag set and, further, by introducing paraphrase tests, we hope to minimize the risk of inter-annotator disagreement in a future annotation on a larger scale. The ontological type annotation As noted above, the ontological types used in the experiments derive from the SIMPLE top ontology (Pedersen, 1999; Lenci et al., 2000) . The heads of the phrases have been annotated with the lowest possible node, i.e. ontological type, of the top ontology. In the case of blodprop the annotation of ontological type is \"disease\", since \"disease\" is the lowest node in the top ontology in the path from thrombosis to the top. This is illustrated in figure 1 , which shows the path from blodprop (thrombosis) to the top level of SIMPLE. Thus, for the purpose of this project, we only consider one node for each concept: the lowest possible node in the top ontology. Another approach would be to consider the the full path to the top node, and also including the path from the leaf node to the lowest node in the top ontology. In the example depicted in figure 1 , the full path from trombosis to the top node would be trombosis-cardiovascular diseasedisease-phenomenon-event-entity-top or trombosiscardiovascular disease-disease-agentive-top. The set of relations For the purpose of the manual relation annotation, we needed to decide on a finite set of possible relations that can be denoted by prepositions. This is a non-trivial task, as it is almost impossible to foresee which relations prepositions can denote generally, and in the text type at hand specifically, by introspection alone. The method that we decided to use was the following: An  initial set of relations that have all been used in prior OntoQuery-related work (Nilsson, 2001; Madsen et al., 2001; Madsen et al., 2000) , were chosen as a point of departure. The final set was found by annotating the text segments using this set as the possible relation types, and the relations that are actually manifested in the data then form the final subset that was used as input for a machine learning algorithm. The final subset is shown in table 2 Paraphrase tests In order to ensure a consistent relation annotation, it is necessary to develop a set of paraphrase tests that can help the annotator determine which relation a given preposition denotes in a given context. Some relations are particularly difficult to intuitively keep apart from closely related relations. One of these problematic relation pairs is treated in some detail below. For example locative and partitive relations can be difficult to keep apart, probably because they to some extent are overlapping semantically. From a philosophical point of view, an important question is 'when does an entity become part of the entity it is located in?', but from a practical point of view, we are interested in answering the question 'how can we decide if a given relation a locative or partitive relation?'. In this paper we will only treat the latter question. A tool that is useful for this purpose is the paraphrase test: If we can paraphrase the text segment in question into the phrasing the test prescribes, while preserving the semantic content, we can conclude that the relation is a possible relation for the given phrase. Attribute Transportation Test The two relations LOC and POF can be difficult to differentiate, even when using paraphrase tests. Therefore, an additional test that could be considered, is Ruus' attribute transportation test (Ruus, 1995) 3 We will here ignore the question of direction of transport Experiments The annotation process generates af a feature space of six dimensions, namely the lemmatized form of the two heads of the noun phrases, the ontological types of the heads, the preposition and the relation. In the corpus there is a total of only 952 text segments. In general the distribution of the data is highly skewed and sparseness is a serious problem. More than half of the instances are of the relation type WRT or PNT, and the rest of the instances are distributed among the remaining 10 relations with only 14 instances scattered over the tree smallest classes. This is illustrated in figure 3 . There are 332 different combinations of ontological types where 197 are unique. There are 681 different heads and 403 of them are unique, with all of them being lemmatized. Figure 3 : An illustration of the distribution of the 12 possible relations. Our assumption is that there is consistency in which relations prepositions usually denote in particular contexts, and hence the learning algorithms should be able to generalize well. We also assume that the addition of the ontological types of the head of the NP, is the most vital information in classifying the relation type, at least in this case where data is sparse. We have run the experiments with a Support Vector Machine algorithm SMO (Keerthi et al., 2001) and the prepositional rule learning algorithm JRip (Cohen, 1995) . The former in order to get high precision, the latter in order to get easily interpretable rules for later analysis (see section 4.1). The experiments were run using 10-fold-cross-validation, with a further partition of the training set at each fold into a tuning and a training set. The tuning set was used to optimize the parameter 4 settings for each algorithm . The implementation of the algorithms that we used, was the WEKA software package (Frank et al., 2005) . The experiments were run on seven different combinations of the feature space, ranging from using only the heads to using both heads, preposition and ontological types of the heads. This was done in order to get insight into the importance of using ontological types in the learning.  The following conclusions can be drawn from table 3. The support vector machine algorithm produces a result which in all cases is better than the baseline, i.e. we are able to produce a model that generalizes well over the training instances compared to the projected classifier or the trivial rejector. This difference is not statistically significant at a confidence level of 0.95 when only training on the surface form of prepositions. A comparison of line 1-3 shows that training on ontological types seems to be superior to using lemmatized NP heads or prepositions, though the superiority is not statistically significant when comparing to the lemmatized NP heads. When comparing line 4-7 the difference between the results are not statistically significant. This fact may owe to the data sparseness. However, comparing line 1 to line 6 or 7, shows that the improvement of adding the preposition and the lemmatized NP heads to the ontological types is statistically significant. In general, the results reveal an unexplored opportunity to include ontological types and the relations that prepositions denote in information retrieval. In the next section, we will look more into the rules created by the JRip algorithm from a linguistic point of view. Analyzing the rules In this section we will take a deeper look into the rules produced by JRip on the data set with only ontological types, since they are the most interesting in this context. The JRip algorithm produced on average 21 rules. The most general rule covering almost half of the instances is the default rule, that assigns all instances to the WRT relation if no other rules apply. At the other end of the spectrum, there are ten rules covering no more than 34 instances, but with a precision of 100%. It is futile to analyse these rules, since they cover the most infrequent relations and hence may be overfitting the data set. However, this seems not be the case with a rule like \"if the ontotype of the first head is DISEASE and and the ontotype of the second head is HUMAN then the relation is PATIENT\" covering an instance as e.g. \"iron deficiency in females\". The rule with the second highest coverage, and a fairly low precision of around 66%, is the rule: \"if the ontotype of the second head is BODY PART then the relation type is LOCATIVE\". The rule covers instances as e.g. \". . . thrombosis in the heart\" but also incorrectly classifies all instances as LOCATIVE where the relation type should be SOURCE. E.g. the sentence '. . . iron absorbtion from the intestine\", which is in fact a SOURCE relation, but is classified as LOCATIVE by the rule. One of the least surprising and most precise rules is: \"if the ontotype of the second head is TIME then the relation type is TEMPORAL\" covering an instance as e.g. \". . . diet for many months\". We would expect a similar rule to be produced, if we had performed the learning task on a general language corpus. Conclusion and future work Even though the experiments are in an early phase, the results indicate that it is possible to analyse the semantic relation a preposition denotes between two noun phrases, by using machine learning and an annotated corpus -at least within the domain covered by the ontology. Future work will therefore include annotation and investigation of a general language corpus. Also, a more thorough examination of the corpus, more specifically an investigation of which relations or prepositions that are most difficult to analyse. Also, we will experiment with the amount of information that we train on, not as we have already done by in-or excluding types of information, but rather the extension of the information: Could we predict the ontological type of one of the arguments by looking at the other? Finally, an explicit inclusion of the whole ontology in the learning process is on the agenda, as proposed in section 3.1.1 on page 3, in the anticipation that the learner will produce an even better model.
