Tiffs information, however, is necessarily incomplete. We report on measurements of the degree of selectional coverage obtained with ditt\\~rent sizes of corpora. We then describe a technique for using the corpus to identify selectionally similar terms, and for using tiffs similarity to broaden the seleetional coverage for a tixed corpus size. Introduction Selectional constraints specify what combinations of words are acceptable or meaningful in particular syntactic relations, such as subject-verb-object or headmodifier relations. Such constraints are necessary for the accurate analysis of natural language text+ Accordingly, the acquisition of these constraints is an essential yet time-consuming part of porting a natural language system to a new domain. Several research groups have attempted to automate this process by collecting co-occurrence patterns (e.g., subject-verb-ol)ject patterns) from a large training corpus. These patterns are then used as the source of seleetional constraints in attalyzing new text. The initial successes of this approach raise the question of how large a training corpus is required. Any answer to this question must of course be relative to the degree of coverage required; the set of selectional patterns will never be 100% complete, so a large corpus will always provide greater coverage. We attempt to shed to some light on this question by processing a large corpus of text from a broad domain (business news) and observing how selectional coverage increases with domain size. In many cases, there are limits on the amount of training text, available. We therefore also consider how coverage can be increased using a tixed amount of text. The most straightforward acquisition procedures build selectional patterns containing only the specific word combinations found in the training corpus. (areater coverage can be obtained by generalizing fl'om the patterns collected so that patterns with semantically related words will also be considered acceptable. In most cases this has been (lotto using manually-created word classes, generalizing fi'oul specific words to their classes [12, 1, 10] . If a pre-existing set of classes is used (as in [10] ), there is a risk that the classes awdlable may not match the needs of the task. If classes are created specifically to capture selectional constraints, there lnay be a substantial manual I>urden in moving to a new domain, since at least some of the semantic word classes will be domain-specillc. We wish to avoid this manual component by auto: maritally identifying semantically related words. This can be done using the co-occurrence data, i.e., by idea: tifying words which occur in the same contexts (for example, verbs which occur with the same subjects and objects). From the co-occurrence data o110 Call coiil.pute a similarity relation between words [8, 7] . This similarity information can then be used in several ways. One approach is to form word clusters based on this similarity relation [8] . This approach was taken by Sekine et al. at UMIST, who then used these chlsters to generalize the semantic patterns [11] . l'ereira et al. [9] used a variant of this approach, \"soft clusters\", in which words can be members of difl'erent clusters to difl'eren t degrees. An alternative approach is to use the word similarity information directly, to inDr information about the likelihood of a co-occurrence pattern from information abont patterns involving similar words. This is the approach we have adopted for our current experiments [6] , and which has also been employed by 17)agan et al. [2] . We corl:lttttl;e from the co+occurrence data a \"confitsion matrix\", which measures the interchangeability of words in particular contexts. We then use the confllsion matrix directly to geueralize the selllantic patterns. Acquiring Semantic Patterns Based on a series of experitnents over tile past two years [5, 6] we have developed the following procedure for acquiring s(;m&lll;ic i)attern.q from a 1;ext (:()i'l)US: l, l)~rsc the trMning corpus using a hro~d-cover~g(~ ~r~i, iilll]~tr) a[ld i'(~ll]~triT, e Lli(! |)arse,~ I,() I)roduce solllethil/g Mdil to ~ul l,F(l f-.sl, ructure, with explic il,ly lal)olod synl;icctic i'ela, tions su0h a,q SUII.1 li]CT and O l:lJ F, CT. i /\"_(< \"2~ \"~\"~, >)~ Tliis probahility infornl~ctiou would l, hcn bc used in scoi'hlg altei'naA;ive p~trse (,rots, [,'or (,lie eva, itla, tiOll l)0-lOW: howcvcr, wc will I18(7 l,h(~ t'r(~tltl011cy tl&~a, l\" directly.

We haw~ l, hcrcfore elected to try an approach which directly uses a form of similarity measnre to smooth (generalize) the prob-. abilities. Co-occurrence smoothing is a method which has been recently proposed for smoothing n-gram models [3].a The core of this method involves the computation of a co-occurrence matrix (a matrix of eonfl, sion probabilities) Pc:(wj Iw0, which indicates the prol)ability of word wj occurring in contexts in which word wi occurs, averaged over these contexts. :L,(wj lwi) : ~ P(wjI,~)P(.~I'~,O E. P(,o~ Is)v(,,,~l,~)V(s) p(wi) where the sum is over the set of all possible contexts s. In applying this technique to the triples we have collected, we have initially chosen to generalize (smooth over) the first element of triple. Thus, in triples of the form wordl relation word2 we focus on wordl, treating relation attd word2 as the context: :'.(~,~lw5 = ~ rO.:l < ,'~j >). v(< ,.w, > In,:) r:v~ F(< ~ ,-~j >) /,(< w~ ,, ~\"5 >) Informally, we ear, say that a large value of /)C'(,,il,)I) indicates that wi is selectionally (semantically) acceptable in the syntactic contexts where word w~ appears. For example, looking at the verb \"convict\", we see that the largest values of P(:(eonvict, x) are for a: = \"acquit\" and x = \"indict\", indicating that \"convict\" is selectionally acceptable in contexts where words \"acquit\" or \"indict\" appear (see Figure 4 for a larger example). How do we use this information to generalize the triples obtained from the corpus'? Suppose we are interested in determining (.he acceptability of the pattern convict-object-owner, even though this triple does not apl)ear in our training corpus. Since \"convict\" can appear in contexts in which \"acquit\" or \"indict\" ap pear, and the patterns acquit-object-owner and indicb o/)ject-owner appear in the corpus, we can conchlde thai, the pattern convict-object-owner is acceptable too. More formally, we compute a smoothed triples frequency lP.s' from the observed frequency /i' by averaging over all words w~, incorporating frequency information for w~ to the extent that its contexts are also suitable contexts for wi: :':~*(< *,:i ,. ,,,j >) --~ r\"(\"'il*\";)\" ::(< ,,,~ ,, ,,:j >) ~tJ lit or(ler to avoid the generation of confltsion table entries from a single shared context (which quite often awe wish to thank Richard Schwartz of BBN for referring us to this method &lid article. is the result of an incorrect I)arse), we apply a filter in generating Pc: for i \u00a2 j, we generate a non-zero Pc(wj Iwj only if the wi and wj appear it* at leant two eoitllnon contexts, and there is some eOlnnlon context in which both words occur at least twice, l,'urthermore, if the value computed by the formula for Pc' is less than some thresbold re:, the value is taken to be zero; we have used rc = 0.001 in the experiments reported below. (These tilters are not applied for the case i = j; the diagonal elements of the confusion matrix are always eomputed exactly.) Because these filters may yeild an an-normalized confltsion matrix (i.e., E~ t>(*vJlv'i) < l), we renorn, alize the n]atrix so that }~,.j [g,(wi[wi ) = 1. A similar approach to pattern generalization, using a sirnilarity measnre derived fi'om co-occurrence data, has been recently described by l)agan et a]. [2] . Theh' approach dill'ers from the one described here in two sign*titan* regards: their co-occurrence data is based on linear distance within the sentence, rather than on syntactic relations, and they use a different similarity measure, based on mutual information. The relative merits of the two similarity rneasures may need to be resolved empirically; however, we believe *bat, there is a virtue to our llOn-sylnlnetric lileaSlll'e~ becatlse 8tll)stitutibility in seleetional contexts is not a symmetric relation .4 Evaluation Evaluation Metric We have previously [5] described two methods for the evaluation of semantic constraints. For tile current ex-periments, we have used one of these methods, where the constraints are evaluated against a set of manually classitied semantic triples. ' ~ For this (waluation, we select a small test corpus separate fl'om the training corpus. We parse the corpus, regularize the parses, and extract triples just as we did tbr the semantic acquisition phase. We then manually classify each triph\" as valid or invalid, depending on whether or not it arises fl'om the correct parse for the sentence. G We then estahlish a threshold 7' for the weighted triples counts in our training set, and deline 4 If v:l allows a hi'o,taler range of argulnents than w2, then we can replace w2 by vq, but llOIb giC(~ versa, For (':xanlple~ w(; can repla(:e \"speak\" (which takes a human subject) by \"sleep\" (which takes an animate subject), and still have a selectionally valid pattern, ])tit. not the other wety around. ~\"l'his is similar to tests conducted by Pcreira ct al. [9] and l)agan et al. [2] . The cited tests, howevcl', were based ,m selected words or word pairs of high frequency, whereas ore\" test sets involve a representative set of high and low frequency triples. stiffs is a different criterion fl'om the one used in our earlier papers. In our earlier work, we marked a triple as wdid if it could be valid in some sentence in the domain. We found that it was very (lilIicult to apply such a standard consistmltly, and have therefore changed to a criterion based on an individual sentence. By wu'ying the l, hreshold, we can a~lcct dill\\went trade-olfs ()f recall and precisioli (at high threshold, we seh~ct: only a small n,,mher of triph:s which apl)eared frequ(mtly and in which we l.hereforc have ]ligh conli--(h!nce, t;hus obtaining a high precision lm(, ]()w recall; conversely, at a h)w t, hrcshohl we adndt a uuuch larger nund)er of i.riplcs, obt,aiuiug ~ high recall but lower precisiol 0. .t .s~ Data The trai,fing and Icst corpora were taken from the Wall Street ,hmrnaJ.

To see how pattern coverage iwl)roves with corpus size, we divided our training corpus into 8 segments and coHll/uted sets of tril)lcs based on the lirst Seglllell|,, the Ih'st two segments, etc. We show iu Figure 2 a plot of recall vs. corpus size, both at ~ consl, ant precision of 72% and for maximum recall regardless of precision .7 The rate of g;rowth of the maximum recall cau be understood in teruls of the frequency distribution of triples. In our earlier work [4] we lit the growth data to curw~s of the form 1 -exp(-fia:), on tile assumpt.ion that all selectional imtterns are t~qually likely. This lttay have 1)ee|l a roughly accurate assumption for that app]ication, involving semantic-class based patterns (rather t, han word-based l);-ttl;erns), and a rather sharply circumscribed sublanguage (m(xlical reports). For the (word level) pal;i,crlls described here, howevcr, the distribution is quite skewed, with a small number of very-high-frequency l)atl,erns, a which results in di[: rN,, (1,tta point is shown for 72% precision for the first seg- fereat growth curves. Figure 3 plots the number of distinct triples per unit frequency, as a function of fi'equency, for the entire training corpus, This data can be very closely approximated by a fimction of tile form N(t,') = al ;'-~, where r~ = 2.9. 9 q'o derive a growth curve for inaxinmln recall, we will assunle that the fl'equeney distribution for triples selected at random follows the same tbrm. Let I) (7) represent the probability that a triple chosen at randorn is a particular triple T. l,et P(p) be the density of triples with a given probability; i.e., the nmnber of triples with probal)ilities between p and p + ( is eP(p) (for small e). Then we are ass,,ming that P(p) = ~p-~, for p ranging fl'om some minimum probability Pmin to 1. For a triple T, the probability that we would lind at least one instance of it in n corpus of w triples is approximately i --c -~p(T). The lnaximum recall for a corpus of ~-triples is the probability of a given triple (the \"test triple\") being selected at random, multiplied by the probability that that triple was found in the training corpus, summed over a.ll triples: ~)(r).

Except ['or the smallest data set, the agreement is quite good considering the wwy simple assumpt, ions made. Smoothing In order to increase our coverage (recall), we then applied the smoothing procedure to the triples fi'om our training corpus. In testing our procedure, we lirst generated the confusioll matrix Pc and examined some of the entries, l\"igure 4 shows the largest entries in f'c for the noun \"bond\", a common word in the Wall Street Journal. It is clear that (with some odd exceptions) most of tile words with high t): wtlues are semantically related to the original word. 'lk) evaluate the etl\\~ctiveness of our smoothing procedure, we have plotted recall vs. precision graphs for both unsmoothed and smoothed frequency data. The results are shown in l,'igure 5. Over tile range of precisions where the two curves overlap, the smoothed data performs better at low precision/high recall, whereas the unsmoothed data is better at high precision/low recall. In addition, smoothing substantially extends the level of recall which can be achieved for a given corpus size, although at some sacrilice in precision. Intuitively we can understand why these curves should (:ross as they do. Smoothing introduces a certain degree of additional error. As is evident from Figure 4 , some of the confllsion matrix entries arc spurious, arising from such SOllrces as incorrect l)arses and the conIlation of word senses. In addition, some of the triples being generalized are themselves incorrect (note that even at high threshold the precision is below 90%).
