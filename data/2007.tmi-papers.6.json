Standalone word sense disambiguation, as exemplified by the Senseval series of evaluations, typically defines the target of disambiguation as a single word. But in order to be useful in statistical machine translation, our studies indicate that word sense disambiguation should be redefined to move beyond the particular case of single word targets, and instead to generalize to multi-word phrase targets. We investigate how and why the phrase sense disambiguation approach-in contrast to recent efforts to apply traditional word sense disambiguation to SMT-is able to yield statistically significant yimprovements in translation quality even under large data conditions, and consistently improve SMT across both IWSLT and NIST Chinese-English text translation tasks. We discuss architectural issues raised by this change of perspective, and consider the new model architecture necessitated by the phrase sense disambiguation approach. Introduction Until recently, attempts to apply word sense disambiguation (WSD) techniques to improve translation quality in statistical machine translation (SMT) models have met with mixed or disappointing results (e.g., Carpuat and Wu (2005) , Cabezas and Resnik (2005) ), suggesting that a deeper empirical exploration of the differences and consequences of the assumptions of WSD and SMT is called for. On one hand, word sense disambiguation as a standalone task consists in identifying the correct sense of a given word among a set of predefined sense candidates. In the Senseval series of evaluations, WSD targets are typically single words, both in the lexical sample tasks, where only a predefined set of targets are considered (e.g., Kilgarriff (2001) ; ), and in the all-words tasks, where all content word in a given corpus must be disambiguated (e.g., Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (1999) ). This focus on single words as WSD targets might be explained by the sense inventory, which is usually derived from a manually constructed dictionary or ontology, where most entries are single words. In addition, historically, as for many other tasks, work on European languages imposed whitespace as an easy way to define convenient the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under GALE Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0023, and by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) research grants RGC6083/99E, RGC6256/00E, and DAG03/04.EG09. Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. word boundaries. Linguistically, however, this oversimplistic modeling approach seems rather questionable, and recalls long-held debates over the issue of what properly constitutes a \"word\". In contrast, work in statistical machine translation has for some time recognized the need to segment sentences as required by the task's evaluation criteria, and today most systems use phrases or segments, and not single words, as the basic unit for lexical choice (e.g., Wu (1997) ; Och and Ney (2004) ; Koehn (2004) ; Chiang (2005) ). Note that single-word based SMT architectures already perform a significant amount of sense disambiguation intrinsically, by virtue of combining a priori sense candidate likelihoods (from adequacy criteria as modeled by lexical translation probabilities) with contextual coherence preferences (from fluency criteria as modeled by language model probabilities). Phrasal SMT architectures, furthermore, integrate lexical collocation preferences into the disambiguation choices, raising the bar yet higher. This suggests that to be effective at improving disambiguation accuracy within SMT architectures, sense disambiguation techniques may need to incorporate assumptions at least as strong as those already made by the SMT models. Dedicated WSD models do appear to possess traits that are promising for SMT: they employ a much broader range of features for sense selection than SMT models, and are far more sensitive to dynamic context. The question, however, is whether these advantages must be reformulated within a phrasal framework in order for the advantages to be realizable for SMT. In this work, we empirically compare the efficacy of phrase sense disambiguation versus word sense disambiguation approaches toward improving translation quality of SMT models. The phrase sense disambiguation (PSD) approach generalizes word sense disambiguation to multiword targets, aiming thereby to incorporate the crucial assumptions responsible for the success of phrasal SMT approaches into the sense disambiguation model as well. Our results and analysis show that it is indeed necessary to move away from the simplistic single-word level definition of sense disambiguation targets, in order to be useful to SMT. In effect, this argues for redefining WSD for the task of SMT. This task-driven approach to sense disambiguation requires several changes: Sense disambiguation targets are very different from Senseval targets. Sense candidates are not extracted from manually defined sense inventories, but from automatically annotated data. Sense disambiguation predictions require a dynamic integration architecture in SMT systems in order to be useful. We will begin by reviewing our phrase sense disambiguation approach for SMT and contrasting it against previous word-based models. We then describe new contrastive empirical studies aimed at directly assessing the differences. On one hand, we note that incorporating multi-word PSD into phrasal SMT reliably and consistently improves translation quality, as measured by all eight most commonly used evaluation metrics, on all four different test sets from the IWSLT and NIST Chinese-English translation tasks. On the other hand, the contrastive experiments reported here show that incorporating single-word WSD into phrasal SMT leads to unpredictable and inconsistent effects on translation quality, depending on which evaluation metric one looks at. We then turn to data analysis exploring more closely how and why the multi-word PSD approach outperforms the single-word WSD approach. The analysis shows that dynamic integration of PSD prediction is crucial to this improvement, as it allows all PSD predictions to participate in the segmention of the input sentence that yields the best translation quality. Previous work In Carpuat and Wu (2007) , we proposed a novel general framework for integrating a generalized sense disambiguation method into SMT, such that phrasal lexical choice is dynamically influenced by context-dependent probabilities or scores. This Phrase Sense Disambiguationas opposed to Word Sense Disambiguationapproach appears to be the only model to date that has been shown capable of consistently yielding improvements on translation quality across all different test sets and automatic evaluation metrics. Other related work has all been heavily oriented toward disambiguating single words. In perhaps the earliest study of WSD potential for SMT performance by Brown et al. (1991) , the authors reported improved translation quality on a French to English task, by choosing an English translation for a French word based on the single contextual feature which is reliably discriminative. However, this was a pilot study, which is limited to single words with exactly two translation candidates, and it is far from clear that the conclusions could generalize to more recent SMT architectures. In contrast with Brown et al.'s work, our approach incorporates the predictions of state-of-the-art WSD models (generalized to PSD models) that use rich contextual features for any phrase in the input vocabulary. More recent work on WSD systems designed for the specific purpose of translation has followed the traditional word-based definition of the WSD task. Vickrey et al. (2005) train a logistic regression WSD model on data extracted from automatically word aligned parallel corpora, and evaluate it on a blank filling task, which is essentially an evaluation of WSD accuracy. Specia et al. (2007) use an inductive logic programming based WSD system to integrate expressive features for Portuguese to English translation, but this system was also only evaluated on WSD accuracy, and not integrated in a fullscale machine translation system. Even when using automatically-aligned SMT parallel corpora to define WSD tasks, as in the SemEval-2007 English Lexical Sample Task via English-Chinese Parallel Text (Ng and Chan, 2007) , WSD is still defined as a word-based task. There have been other attempts at using context information for lexical selection in SMT, but the focus was also on single words vs. multi-word phrases, and they were not evaluated in terms of translation quality. For instance, Garcia-Varea et al. (2001) and Garcia-Varea et al. (2002) show improved alignment error rate with a maximum entropy based context-dependent lexical choice model, but do not report improved translation accuracy. Another problem in the context-sensitive SMT models of Garcia Varea et al. is that they strictly reside within the Bayesian source-channel model, which is word-based. The few recent attempts at integrating single word based WSD models into SMT have failed to obtain clear improvements in terms of translation quality. Carpuat and Wu (2005) show that using word-based Senseval trained models does not help BLEU score when integrated in a standard word-based translation system, for a NIST Chinese-English translation task. Following this surprising result, a few attempts at integrating WSD methods into state-of-theart SMT systems have begun to obtain slightly more encouraging results by moving away from manually-constructed sense inventories, and instead automatically defining word senses as word translation candidates, just like in SMT. Cabezas and Resnik (2005) reported that incorporating word-based WSD predictions via the Pharaoh XML markup scheme yielded a small improvement in BLEU score over a phrasal SMT baseline on a single Spanish-English translation data set. However, the result was not statistically significant, and in this paper, we will show that applying a similar single-word based model to several Chinese-English datasets does not yield systematic improvements on most MT evaluation metrics. Carpuat et al. (2006) also reported small improvements in BLEU score by using single-word WSD predictions in a Pharaoh baseline. However, these small improvements were obtained on a slightly weaker SMT baseline, and subsequent evaluations showed that these gains are not consistent across metrics. Gim\u00e9nez and M\u00e0rquez (2007) also used WSD predictions in Pharaoh for the slightly more general case of very frequent phrases, which in practice essentially limits the set of WSD targets to single words or very short phrases. However, evaluation on the single Europarl Spanish-English task did not yield consistent improvements across metrics: BLEU score did not improve, while there were small improvements in the QUEEN, METEOR and ROUGE metrics. Chan et al. (2007) report an improved BLEU score for a hierarchical phrase-based SMT system on a NIST Chinese-English task, by incorporating WSD predictions only for single words and short phrases of length 1 or 2. However, no results for metrics other than BLEU were reported, and no results on other tasks, so the relia-bility of this model is not known. What the foregoing attempts at WSD in SMT share is that (1) they focus on single words rather than full phrases, and (2) the evaluations do not show consistent improvement systematically across different tasks and metrics. In contrast, we showed in Carpuat and Wu (2007) for the first time that generalizing WSD to exactly match phrasal lexical choice in SMT yields consistent improvements on 4 different test sets as measured by 8 common automatic evaluation metrics, unlike all the single-word oriented approaches. The key question left unanswered, however-which we attempt to address in the present paper-is exactly how and why it is necessary to generalize Word Sense Disambiguation to Phrase Sense Disambiguation in order to obtain this sort of consistency in translation accuracy improvement. Building multi-word Phrase Sense Disambiguation models for SMT Phrase sense disambiguation vs. word sense disambiguation In a task-driven definition of sense disambiguation for phrase-based SMT, the PSD approach argues that disambiguation targets must be exactly the same phrases as in the SMT phrasal translation lexicon, so that the sense disambiguation task is identical to lexical choice for SMT. This constrasts with the standalone WSD perspective, where targets are single words, as in Senseval tasks (e.g., Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (1999) ). In SMT, phrases are typically defined as any sequence of words up to a given length. As a result, the phrasal targets for sense disambiguation need not necessarily be syntactic well-formed phrases, but rather need only be collocations defined by their surface form. This again departs from Senseval-style WSD where POS-tagging is typically decoupled from WSD, as training data is manually checked to contain instance for a single POS of the target. In sense disambiguation for SMT, the sense candidates are those defined by the SMT translation lexicon. Sense candidates can be single words or multi-word phrases regardless of the length of the target. Note that phrasal senses do occasionally also exist in standalone WSD tasks. For instance, the Senseval English Lexical Sample tasks include WordNet phrasal senses (e.g., \"polar bear\" is a sense candidate for the English target word \"bear\".) Given the above definitions for sense disambiguation targets and senses, annotated training data can naturally be drawn from the automatically aligned parallel corpora used to learn the SMT lexicon. Given a Chinese-English sentence pair, a WSD or PSD target in the Chinese sentence is annotated with the English phrase which is consistent with the word alignment. The definition of consistency with the word alignment should be exactly the one used for building the SMT lexicon. Despite the differences introduced by the use of phrasal targets, the disambiguation task remains in the character and spirit of WSD. The translation lexical choice problem is exactly the same task as in recent and coming Senseval Multilingual Lexical Sample tasks (e.g., Chklovski et al. (2004) ), where sense inventories represent the semantic distinctions made by another language. In our SMT-driven approach to PSD rather than WSD, we are only generalizing the definition of the sense disambiguation targets, and automating the sense annotation process. Leveraging Senseval classifiers for both WSD and PSD As in Carpuat and Wu (2007) , the word sense disambiguation system is modeled after the best performing WSD system in the Chinese lexical sample task at Senseval-3 (Carpuat et al., 2004) . The features employed include position-sensitive, syntactic, and local collocational features, and are therefore much richer than those used in most SMT systems. Integrating multi-word PSD vs. single-word WSD into phrasal SMT architectures Unlike single-word WSD, it is non-trivial to incorporate the PSD predictions into an existing phrase-based architecture such as Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) , since the decoder is not set up to easily accept multiple translation probabilities that are dynamically computed in context-sensitive fashion. While PSD and WSD models differ in principle only by the length of the WSD target, their integration into phrase-based SMT architectures requires significantly different strategies. Since multi-word PSD predictions are defined for every entry in the SMT lexicon or phrase table, they can be thought of as an additional feature in the phrase table. However, unlike baseline SMT translation probabilities, these predictions are context-sensitive, and require to be updated for every new sentence. Therefore, instead of using a static phrasal translation lexicon, integration of PSD predictions require dynamically updating the phrasal translation lexicon for each sentence during decoding. In contrast, in the single-word WSD system, since the WSD predictions only cover a subset of the phrase-table entries and the word-based targets do not have overlapping spans, it is usually possible to implement a much simpler integration architecture, by annotating the input sentence to contain the WSD predictions, as with the Pharaoh XML markup scheme. Thus, the dynamic phrase table architecture for PSD integration necessarily generates a significant overhead. While we could in theory annotate the input sentence with phrase-based WSD predictions, just like for single-word based WSD, we argue that this approach is not optimal and would in fact hurt translation quality: annotation schemes such as the Pharaoh XML markup do not allow to annotate overlapping spans, and would thus require to commit to a phrasal segmentation of the input sentence before decoding. It is impossible to find an optimal phrasal segmentation before decoding, since the quality of the segmentation can only be evaluated by the translation it yields. Comparative experiment setup Data set In order to better isolate the different effects of WSD versus PSD, comparative experiments are conducted using training and evaluation data drawn from the multilingual BTEC corpus, which contains sentences used in conversations in the travel domain, and their translations in several languages. The simpler character of these sentences faciliates clearer identification of individual factors in data analysis, compared with open domain newsire text where too many factors interfere with each other. We used a subset of this data which was made available for the IWSLT 2006 evaluation campaign; the training set consists of 40000 sentence pairs, and each test set contains around 500 sentences. We used only the pure text data, so that speech-specific issues would not interfere with our primary goal of understanding the effect of integrating WSD/PSD in a full-scale phrasal SMT model. We also report results of the large scale evaluation of the PSD model conducted on the standard NIST Chinese-English test set (MT-04), which contains 1788 sentences drawn from newswire corpora, and is therefore of a much wider domain than the IWSLT data set. Baseline SMT system Since our focus is not on a specific SMT architecture, we use the off-the-shelf phrase-based decoder Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) trained in a standard fashion on the IWSLT training set, as in Carpuat and Wu (2007) . WSD and PSD models WSD classifiers are trained for every word, while PSD classifiers are trained for every multi-word phrase in the test set vocabularies. The number of targets is therefore much higher than even in the all-words WSD tasks. For the first IWSLT test set which contains 506 sentences, we have a total of PSD 2882 targets, as opposed to only 948 WSD targets. There is on average 7.3 sense candidates and 79 training instances per PSD target. The scale of WSD and PSD models for SMT greatly constrasts with, for instance, the Senseval-3 Chinese lexical sample task which considered only 21 single word targets, with an average of 3.95 senses and 37 training instances per target. Comparative evaluation results The comparative experiments clearly show a marked difference between single-word WSD and multi-word PSD results. Evaluation scores, summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , show that multiword PSD yields consistent improvements in translation quality, across all metrics and on all test sets, including statistically significant improvements on the large NIST task, while in contrast, the impact of single-word WSD on translation quality is highly unpredictable. In particular, the single-word WSD results are inconsistent across different test sets, and depend on which evaluation metric is chosen. In order to measure the impact of WSD on translation quality, the translation results were evaluated using all eight of the most commonly used automatic evaluation metrics. In addition to the widely used BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) scores, we also evaluate translation quality with METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) , Word Error Rate (WER), Position-independent word Error Rate (PER) (Tillmann et al., 1997) , CDER (Leusch et al., 2006) , and Translation Edit Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) . Note that we report ME-TEOR scores computed both with and without using WordNet synonyms to match translation candidates and references, showing that the improvement is not due to context-independent synonym matches at evaluation time. In the sections that follow, we investigate various reasons that PSD outperforms WSD, drawing from data analysis on these comparative experiments. Single-word WSD yields unreliable results Using WSD predictions for all the single words in a given test set has an unreliable impact on translation quality, as can be seen in Table 1 . While it yields a very small, non-significant gain on NIST and METEOR on Test Set 1, it yields worse BLEU, NIST and METEOR scores for all the other test sets. In order to check that this disappointing result cannot be simply explained by the effect of unusual target words, we perform two sets of additional experiments. We attempt to consider only target words that are closer to those used in Senseval evaluations for which these WSD models were initially designed, and demonstrated good performance. Instead of using WSD predictions for all the whitespace separated tokens that were seen during training, we restrict our set of WSD targets to nouns and verbs. This is slightly closer to the definition of targets in Senseval tasks, which typically include nouns, verbs and sometimes adjectives, but never punctuation or any function word. Table 1 shows that this does not help translation quality compared to the baseline system, and actually underperforms using WSD predictions for all words. In contrast with Senseval target words, which are picked so that representative training data can be obtained, we are using every target word in the vocabulary, whatever the available training data. In order to check that the target words with few training instances are not hurting the contribution of other targets, we try to restrict our set of target words to those for which at least 30 instances were seen during training. Table 1 shows that this does not have a reliable effect on translation quality either, yielding small gains in BLEU, NIST and METEOR scores over the baseline for Test Sets 2 and 3, but hurting BLEU on Test Set 1. While the results are overall slightly better than when using all WSD predictions for all words, there is no clear trend for improvement. These results show that considering only single words as sense disambiguation targets does not allow the SMT system to reliably exploit WSD predictions. This holds even when only targets that meet conditions that are closer to Senseval evaluations, where our WSD models are known to achieve good performance. Multi-word PSD consistently improves translation quality In contrast with the unreliable single-word WSD results, using phrasal multi-word PSD predictions in SMT remarkably yields better translation quality on all test sets, as measured by all eight commonly used automatic evaluation metrics. The results are shown in Table 2 for IWSLT and Table 3 for the NIST task. Paired bootstrap resampling shows that the improvements on the NIST test set are statistically significant at the 95% level. Comparison of the 1-Best decoder output with and without the PSD feature shows that the sentences differ by one or more token respectively for 25.49%, 30.40% and 29.25% of IWSLT test sets 1, 2 and 3, and 95.74% of the NIST test set. 9 Multi-word PSD helps the decoder find a more useful segmentation of the input sentence Analysis reveals that integrating PSD into SMT helps the decoder select a phrase segmentation of the input sentence which allows to find better translations than word-based WSD. We sampled translation examples from the IWSLT test sets, so that both word-based and phrase-based results are available for comparison. In addition, the relatively short sentence length of this corpus helps give a clearer understanding of the impact of WSD. Consider the following example: Input \u00a2\u00a1 \u00a4\u00a3 \u00a6\u00a5 \u00a8 \u00a7 \u00a9 \"! # $ Reference I want to reconfirm this ticket. PSD I want to reconfirm my reservation for this ticket. Here, in the input segment \" ! # \", the particle \" \" is in the same segment as the preceding word when using multi-word PSD predictions (\" \"), while the single-word WSD prefers to use \" ! \"# \". This results in an incorrect translation of the phrase \" ! # \" as \"flight for\". In contrast, PSD prefers to use the target \" ! # \", which ranks the correct \"reservation\" as the top translation candidate with a very confident probability of 0.94, as opposed to 0.28 only for the baseline context-independent translation probability used in the single-word WSDaugmented model. Similarly, consider: Input \u00a1 \u00a3\u00a2 \u00a3\u00a4 \u00a6\u00a5 \u00a8 \u00a7 \u00a3\u00a9 $ Reference You should transfer to the Central Line. WSD Please turn to the Central Line. PSD Please transfer to Central Line. Here, PSD translates the segment \" \u00a2 \u00a4 \" as a single unit and selects the correct translation \"transfer to\", while WSD separately translates the words \" \u00a2 \" and \" \u00a4 \" into the incorrect \"turn to\". The multi-word PSD model correctly ranks \"transfer to\" as its translation candidate, but it is interesting to note that all other translation candidates (e.g., \"have a connection to\") are better than \"turn to\", because the sense disambiguation target phrase itself contains disambiguating information, and is therefore a better lexical choice unit. Consider a further example: Input \u00a1 \u00a6 ! #\" $ &% (' )\" 10 &2 43 65 Reference I'd like to call Tokyo, Japan. What time is it now in Tokyo? WSD I want to make a call to Tokyo, Japan is Tokyo time now? PSD I want to make a call to Tokyo, Japan what time is it now in Tokyo? The PSD system translates the phrase \" 0 !2 \u00a63 \" as a single target into \"what time is\", with a confident PSD probability of 0.90. This prediction is not used by the WSD-augmented system, because the context-independent baseline translation probabilities prefers the incorrect translation \"what time does it\" higher than \"what time is\", with much less confident scores (0.167 vs. 0.004). As a result, using only WSD predictions leads the words \" 0 \" and \" 2 3 \" to be translated separately, and incorrectly. In contrast, the following example demonstrates how multi-word PSD helps in selecting a mix of both longer and shorter phrases where appropriate: Input \u00a1 \u00a37 \u00a38 @9 \u00a2\u00a9 &A 7 !B \u00a2\u00a9 $ Reference Please fix it or exchange it. WSD Please fix it or I change it for me. PSD Please give me fix it or exchange it for me. In particular, by translating the phrase \" \u00a1 C7 \" as a whole, multi-word PSD avoids the problem caused by the incorrect reordering of the pronoun \"I\" in single-word WSD. The phrase translation is not optimal, but it is better than the singleword WSD translation, which does not make much sense because of the incorrect reordering. At the same time, the multi-word PSD predictions do not translate the phrase \" @\" D0 E2 F3 \" as a single target, which helps pick the better translation \"exchange\". It is worth noting that using multi-word PSD sometimes yields better lexical choice than single-word WSD even in cases when the same phrase segmentation of the input sentence is arrived at. This is the case in the following examples: Input 0 \u00a2\u00a1 \u00a4\u00a3 \u00a6\u00a5 \u00a8 \u00a7 $ Reference This is all my personal luggage. WSD Is it all personal effects. PSD They are all personal effects. Input \u00a9 \u00a4 $ ! \"\u00a1 5 Reference Which would you like, coffee or tea? WSD Which would you like, and coffee black tea? PSD Which would you like, black tea or coffee? The targets that are translated differently are single words in both sentences, which means that the WSD/PSD predictions are identical in the WSD-augmented SMT and PSD-augmented SMT experiments. However, the translation candidate selected by the decoder differs. In the first example, the WSD/PSD scores incorrectly prefer \"and\" with a probability of 0.967 to the better \"or\" translation, which is only given a probability of 0.002. However, the PSD-based translation for the whole sentence is correct, while the WSDbased translation is incorrectly ordered, perhaps letting the language model prefer the phrase \"and coffee\" which was seen 10 times more in the training set than the correctly ordered \"and tea\". Although this phenomenon requires more analysis, we suspect that having WSD predictions for every phrase in the SMT lexicon allows to learn better log linear model weights than for wordbased WSD predictions. When WSD/PSD predictions go wrong The following examples show that for some sentences using sense disambiguation, whether single-word WSD or multi-word PSD, occasionally does not help or even hurts translation quality. Consider the following example: Input \u00a6 # %$ \u00a6& (' $ Reference Room service, please. WSD I will take meal service. PSD I want to eat service. Here, the single word target \" # \" is incorrectly translated as \"eat\" and \"meal\", while a better translation candidate, \"order\", is given a lower WSD score. Another problem with this sentence is that the word \" & )' \" is not seen alone during training, but in the collocation \"0 21 & 3' \", so that \" & 4' \" was aligned to \"service\" only during training, and \"room service\" is not a translation candidate for \" & 5' \" in the SMT phrasal translation lexicon. WSD/PSD can only help to rank the given candidates, and there is nothing they can do when the correct translation is not in the original SMT phrasal translation lexicon. Similarly, consider the following example: Input 6 $ 7 87 @9 $ Reference Uhh. Give me a Tab. WSD Oh. I have the bill. PSD Well, let me check. The incorrect translation of \" 7 A9 $ \" as \"check .\" by the multi-word PSD model inappropriately influences the translation of the context, resulting in a sentence translation whose meaning has nothing in common with the reference. This, of course, highlights the fact that for extremely short sentences containing only neutral words or extremely polysemous function words, WSD/PSD is not a good idea. In Example 7, there is actually no solid contextual evidence upon which the sense disambiguation model can decide whether \" 7 B9 \" should be translated as \"bill\", \"check\", or \"tab\". \" 7 \" is the highly polysemous verb \"give\", and \" \" is the neutral word \"I\". In fact, without document level context, it would be hard even for a human translator to pick the right translation. These observations suggest that in future evolutions of these directions, we might want to trigger PSD based on a cursory examination of sentence properties, in order to avoid hurting translation quality when there is simply no context information for PSD to exploit. Conclusion We have presented new comparative empirical evidence and data analysis strongly indicating that in order to be useful for improving the translation quality of current phrasal SMT performance levels, we will need phrase sense disambiguation models that are generalized to disambiguate phrasal target words, rather than traditional single-word sense diambiguation models. On one hand, the experimental results conducted on both the IWSLT-06 and NIST Chinese-English translation tasks, using eight different automatic evaluation metrics, have shown thatremarkably-incorporating phrase sense disambiguation consistently improves translation quality on all test sets for all evaluation metrics. But on the other hand, contrastive results where traditional single-word oriented WSD is incorporated into SMT leads to unpredictable effects on translation quality depending on the metric used, thus tending to confirm that the generalization from word sense disambiguation to phrase sense disambiguation is indeed necessary. Analysis suggests that this very different behavior is made possible by the dynamic integration of phrase-based WSD predictions into SMT, which allow all phrase targets to compete during decoding, instead of forcing the SMT system to use a particular segmentation of its input sentence.",
