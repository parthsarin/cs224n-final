The idea is to use the dictionary to mine the unlabeled target data for unambiguous word sequences, thus effectively collecting labeled target data. We add the mined instances to available labeled newswire data to train a POS tagger for the target domain. The induced models significantly improve tagging accuracy on held-out test sets across three domains (Twitter, spoken language, and search queries). We also present results for Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese Twitter data, and provide two novel manually-annotated test sets. Introduction Part-of-speech (POS) taggers are typically trained on newswire and exhibit severe out-of-domain performance drops (Blitzer et al., 2006; Daume III, 2007; Foster et al., 2011) . When faced with a new domain, one option is to try to leverage available unlabeled data. However, rather than resorting to pure self-training approaches (self-labeling), we here resort to another source of information. One way to address the annotation problem is to use collaboratively created resources such as Wikipedia for distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) , or the automatically derived dictionaries called Wiktionary (Li et al., 2012) . We show how to leverage these resources to create labeled training data. It turns out that many entries in Wiktionary are actually unambiguous, i.e., there is only one possible tag for the word. In fact, for English Wiktionary (Li et al., 2012) , we find that 93% of the unigram types are unambiguous (cf. Table 2 ). Our idea here is simple: we mine for unlabeled sentences that contain only unambiguous items (according to Wiktionary), and use the resulting data as additional, labeled training material. Concretely, we mine unannotated corpora of tweets, transcribed speech, and search queries for sentences that contain only unambiguous tokens, and combine those instances with newswire data to train POS models that adapt better to the respective domains. We show that adding unambiguous data leads to considerable improvements over both unadapted and weakly-supervised baselines (Li et al., 2012) . Since Wiktionary has relatively low coverage for some of these domains, we also explore the use of Brown clusters to extend the coverage. This enables us to generalize across spelling variations and synonyms. Additionally, we evaluate our approach on Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish Twitter and present tow novel data sets for the latter two languages. Data Wiktionary In our experiments, we use the (unigram) tag dictionaries from Wiktionary, as collected by Li et al. (2012) . 1 The size and quality of our tag dictionaries crucially influence how much unambiguous data we can extract, and for some languages, the number of dictionary entries is small. We can resort to normalization dictionaries to extend Wiktionary's coverage. We do so for English (Han and Baldwin, 2011) spelling variations with the standard form (youuuuuuuu \u2192 you), which reduces the vocabulary size. For languages where no such normalization dictionary is available, we use word clusterings based on Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) In particular, to extend the dictionary D to D using clusters, we first run clustering on the unlabeled data T , using Brown clustering. 2 We then assign to each unambiguous word in the cluster its tag from dictionary D. For all remaining tokens in the same cluster, we assign them the most frequently observed tag in the cluster, provided that label occurred at least twice as often as the second most frequent one, and the token itself was not already in Wiktionary. As an example, consider the cluster in Figure 1 . Since three tokens were unambiguously tagged as ADV in the original dictionary (previously, already, recently), we project ADV to all tokens in the cluster that were not already in D (here: alreadyyy, finali, aleady), and finally add all words to D . The token offish remains an ADJ. 2 https://github.com/percyliang/ brown-cluster Unlabeled data For each domain and language, given dictionary D, we extract unambiguous sentences/tweets. User names and URLs are assumed to be nouns. If all words are unambiguous according to the dictionary, we include the sentence/tweet in our training data. For hashtags on Twitter, we remove the \"#\" sign and check the remainder against the dictionary. We exclude tweets that only contain users and URLs. The unambiguous subsets of the unlabeled data represent very biased samples of the various domains. The ratio of unambiguous English tweets, for example, is only about 0.012 (or 1 in 84), and the distribution of tags in the Twitter data set is heavily skewed towards nouns, while several other labels are under-represented. Twitter We collect the unlabeled data from the Twitter streaming API. 3 We collected 57m tweets for English, 8.2m for Spanish, 4.1m for Portuguese, and 0.5m for Dutch. We do not perform sentence splitting on tweets, but take them as unit sequences. Spoken language We use the Switchboard corpus of transcribed telephone conversations (Godfrey et al., 1992) , sections 2 and 3, as well as the English section of EuroParl (Koehn, 2005) and CHILDES (MacWhinney, 1997) . We removed all meta-data and inline annotations (gestures, sounds, etc.), as well as dialogue markers. The final joint corpus contains transcriptions of 570k spoken sentences. Search queries For search queries, we use a combination of queries from Yahoo 4 and AOL. We only use the search terms and ignore any additional information, such as user ID, time, and linked URLs. The resulting data set contains 10m queries. Labeled data We train our models on newswire, as well as mined unambiguous instances. For English, we use the OntoNotes release of the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank as training data for Twitter, spoken data, and queries. 5 For Dutch, we use the training section of the Alpino treebank from the CoNLL task. 6  For Portuguese, we use the training section of the Bosque treebank. 7 For Spanish, we use the training section of the Cast3LB treebank. 8 In order to map between Wiktionary and the treebanks, we need a common coarse tag set. We thus map all data to the universal tag set (Petrov et al., 2012) . Dev and test sets Our approach is basically parameter free. However, we did experiment with different ways of extending Wiktionary and hence used an average over three English Twitter dev sections as development set (Ritter et al., 2011; Gimpel et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2011) , all mapped and normalized following Hovy et al. (2014) . For evaluation, we use three domains: tweets, spoken data and queries. For Twitter, we performed experiments in four languages: English, Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch. The Spanish and Portuguese tweets were annotated in-house, which will be made available. 9 For the other languages, we use preexisting datasets for English (Hovy et al., 2014) and Dutch (Avontuur et al., 2012) . Table 2 lists the complete statistics for the different language data sets. For the other two domains, we use the manually labeled data from Switchboard section 4 as spoken data test set. For queries, we use manually labeled data from Bendersky et al. (2010) . Experiments Model We use a CRF 10 model (Lafferty et al., 2001) with the same features as Owoputi et al. (2013) and de-fault parameters. As baselines we consider a) a CRF model trained only on newswire; b) available off-the-shelf systems (TOOLS); and c) a weakly supervised model (LI10). For English, the off-theshelf tagger is the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) , for the other languages we use TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) with pre-trained models. The weakly supervised model trained is on the unannotated data. It is a second-order HMM model (Mari et al., 1997; Thede and Harper, 1999) (SOHMM) using logistic regression to estimate the emission probabilities. This method allows us to use feature vectors rather than just word identity, as in standard HMMs. In addition, we constrain the inference space of the tagger using type-level tag constraints derived from Wiktionary. This model, called LI10 in Table 3 , was originally proposed by Li et al. (2012) . We extend the model by adding continuous word representations, induced from the unlabeled data using the skip-gram algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013) , to the feature representations. Our logistic regression model thus works over a combination of discrete and continuous variables when estimating emission probabilities. This extended model is called LI10 + . For both models, we do 50 passes over the data as in Li et al. (2012) . Results Table 3 presents results for various models on several languages. Our results show that our newswiretrained CRF model with target-specific Brown clusters already does better than all our other baseline models (TOOLS and weakly LI10) , with the exception of QUERIES, where the Stanford tagger does remarkably well. All improvements are statistically significant (p < 0.005, calculated using approximate randomization with 10k iterations). Adding the unambiguous unlabeled data leads to further improvements, with error reductions (over CRF) of up to 20%. The exceptions here are Portuguese tweets and SPOKEN. For SPOKEN, this is due to the small amounts of unlabeled data, so we re-used the clusters induced on Twitter, reasoning that language use in these two domains is similar to each other. Despite this conjecture, we see small improvements. For English, Portuguese, and Spanish TWITTER, as well as QUERIES, we see further   considerable improvements by using our extended tag dictionaries. The most obvious reason this approach should work is the decrease in unseen words in the indomain evaluation data. Since the unambiguous data is in-domain, the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate goes down when we add the unambiguous data to the newswire training data. In fact, for English Twitter, the OOV rate is reduced by half, and for Portuguese and Spanish, it is reduced by about 40%. For Dutch Twitter, the reduction in OOV rate is much smaller, which probably explains the small gain for this dataset. The difference in reduction of OOV rates are due to sample biases in our unlabeled data. This probably also explains the difference in gains between SPEECH and QUERIES. For search queries, the OOV rate is reduced by 66%, whereas it stays roughly the same for speech transcripts. Discussion We have presented a simple, yet effective approach to adapt POS taggers to a new domain. It requires a) the availability of large amounts of unlabeled data and b) a lexicon to mine unambiguous sentences. As sentence length increases, the likelihood of being completely unambiguous drops. For this reason, our approach works well for domains with shorter average sentence length, such as Twitter, spoken language, and search queries. We also experimented with allowing up to one ambiguous item per sentence, i.e., we include a sentence in our training data if it contains exactly one item that either a) has more than one licensed tag in the dictionary or b) is not in the dictionary. In the first case, we choose the tag randomly at training time from the set of licensed ones. In the second case, we assume the unknown word to be a NOUN, since unknown words mostly tend to be proper names. When added to newswire, this data results in worse models, presumably by introducing too much noise. However, for low-resource languages or domains with longer sentences and no available newswire data, this might be a viable alternative. Related Work Our approach is similar to mining high-precision items. However, previous approaches on this in NLP have mainly focused on well-defined classification tasks, such as PP attachment (Pantel and Lin, 2000; Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2005) , or discourse connective disambiguation (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002) . In contrast, we mine for sequences of unambiguous tokens in a structured prediction task. While we use the same dictionaries as in Li et al. (2012) and T\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m et al. (2013) , our approach differs in several respects. First, we use Wiktionary to mine for training data, rather than as type constraints, and second, we use Brown clusters to extend Wiktionary. We did experiment with different ways of doing this, including using various forms of word embeddings, leading to models similar to the baseline models in Socher et al. (2013) , but the approach based on Brown clusters led to the best results on our development data. ?) use a different approach to distant supervision to improve tagging accuracy for Twitter. They use hyperlinks to fetch additional un-annotated training data that can be used in a self-training loop. Our approach differs in that it produces annotated data and is more readily applicable to various domains. Conclusion We have presented a domain adaptation approach to POS tagging by augmenting newswire data with automatically mined unambiguous instances. We demonstrate our approach on Twitter (in several languages), spoken language transcripts, and search queries. We use dictionaries extended with Brown clusters to collect labeled training data from unlabeled data, saving additional annotation work. Our models perform significantly better on heldout data than both off-the-shelf taggers and models trained on newswire data only. Improvements hold across several languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch). For spoken language tran-scripts and search queries, we see some improvements, but find that extending the dictionaries with clusters has less of an effect than for Twitter. Our method can provide a viable alternative to costly annotation when adapting to new domains where unlabeled data and dictionaries are available.
