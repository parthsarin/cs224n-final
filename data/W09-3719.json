    "article": "Using the RST annotated corpus [Carlson et al., 2003] , we use simple statistics on the distribution of discourse markers or cue phrases as evidence of the three-way distinction of Contrast relations, Contrast, Antithesis and Concession, recognized in standard Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST, Mann and Thompson 1987). We also show that however, an intuitive marker of Contrast, is not actually used statistically signicantly more often in Contrast relations than in Cause-Eect relations. These results highlight the need for empirically based discourse marker identication rather than the intuitive method that is the current norm. Introduction Contrast is a central rhetorical relation. It is one of the most frequent, as shown by discourse annotation projects. It seems to have a clear, intuitive semantic meaning, and has been argued to interact with other linguistic structures like VP-ellipsis (see e.g. Kehler 2000) . Finally, it is instinctively associated with several very clear discourse markers, such as e.g. however, although and but. However, there is a lack of consensus about whether or not there are qualitatively dierent Contrast relations: RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) recognizes three dierent types: Contrast proper, Antithesis and Concession, Wolf and Gibson [2005] recognize two, denial of expectation and contrast, and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT, Asher and Lascarides 2003) recognizes one: Contrast. In this paper we use the annotated RST corpus [Carlson et al., 2003] and simple lexical cooccurrance statistics to determine if intuitive discourse markers of contrast reliably identify Contrast from Cause-Eect relations and if the markers also distinguish between the three-way distinction made in RST. The distribution of markers shows that intuition can be surprisingly wrong, e.g. however was not a reliable marker of Contrast. We also found that the dierent RST Contrast relations can be distinguished by their markers. These results illustrate the need for empirically testing intuitively identied rhetorical relation markers, and argue against collapsing the Contrast distinctions, as has been done in many discourse annotation schemes. 2 Contrast as a rhetorical relation Theoretically, RST leaves the number of relations recognized up to the annotator [Mann and Thompson, 1987] , but in the manually annotated RST corpus [Carlson et al., 2003] 78 relations are stipulated, including three Contrast relations: Contrast, Antithesis and Concession. As mentioned above, Wolf and Gibson [2005] recognize two Contrast relations among the 11 relations they distinguish between, `violated expectation' and `contrast', a distinction which seems to have been inherited from Hobbs [1985] , who may have in turn taken it from Lako [1971] . In the manual Reese et al. [2007] for the annotation of texts according to SDRT, there is only one contrast relation among the 14 relations recognized. Thus RST recognizes the greatest number of contrast types, but there is no empirical evidence supporting these or any other distinctions. The distinctions between dierent types of Contrast found in current discourse annotation schemes seem to have been adapted from theoretical linguistic work on contrast that sought to characterize the way in which the conjunction but diers from and. Lako [1971] made a distinction between what she called denial of expectation contrast and semantic opposition uses of but, e.g. (1) It's raining but I'm taking an umbrella. (2) John is tall but Bill is short. (Lako 1971: 133) Denial of expectation has semantically been interpreted as a case where the rst conjunct implicates a proposition that the second conjunct denies, e.g. in (1) It's raining implicates the speaker will get wet, while having an umbrella negates this implication. Semantic opposition contrast on the other hand is characterized by the fact that the conjuncts have parallel elements contrasted along one dimension, e.g. in (2), John and Bill are humans contrasted according to their height. The three RST relations seem to preserve the same the distinction. Antithesis and Contrast are described as having contrast happen in only one or few respects, while everything else can remain the same in other respects. (Annotation manual, [Carlson and Marcu, 2001] isn't the fact that it will take so long to reach a verdict considered a kind of denial of expectation ? Are the dates the parallel elements in Antithesis 2? The annotation doesn't require explicitly identifying these structures but the denitions imply they should be present. In many ways, Antithesis 2 seems to share more with Concession 6. For Concession 5 we could also easily argue that the brokerage operation and Kidder are parallel elements while prots or losses is the measure of comparison. In the end, the corpus has a similar problem to all materials with annotations where there is no clear, objective method of categorization. We have to simply accept the annotation as reliable and see if the results we obtain with it makes sense. 3 Previous research analyzing cue words Taboada [2006] used the RST corpus and a corpus of task oriented dialogues that she annotated with RST relations to identify the most frequently used discourse markers for a number of RST relations. Most relevant for the current work are her results for unembedded Concession relations. In the RST corpus she found that 90.35% of the relations were marked with some recognisable discourse marker, with the words but and although contributing to 50% of the marked relations. Other markers she identied were though, despite, while, even though, however, still, even if, even when, even yet, whether and whereas. Another relevant result concerns the distribution of discourse markers across nuclei and satellites. She found that for Concession, the markers were equally likely to occur in the nucleus or satellite. The main problem with this study is that it relies on intuition for the initial identication of the Concession markers, and then the frequency with which they intuitively seem to be signaling contrast is used as evidence of the correctness of the initial intuition. But this means that relevant markers might be missed. Experiments We used the annotated RST corpus as data [Carlson et al., 2003] . This corpus has approximately 176,000 words composed of 385 articles from the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank. We extracted all Contrast, Antithesis, Concession, Evidence, Cause and Result relations, 1 including relations that contained embedded relations. We then use \u03c7 2 tests to check for statistically signicant correlations between lexical items and the dierent coherence relations. We only report results for a small set of closed class words that are particularly likely to be discourse markers. First, from the results in Table 1 Next, we examined dierent groupings of the contrast relations to see if there is evidence that the three categories of contrast distinguished by RST actually show a dierent distribution of discourse markers. The three Contrast relations can be further grouped along two features, their nuclearity and the way in which they create the contrastive meaning. Antithesis and Concession are both mononuclear relations while Contrast is multinuclear. Are either of these features reected in the type of discourse markers the relations cooccur with? It is highly possible that nuclearity would limit which discourse markers cooccur with which relations given that nuclearity to a certain degree correlates with the coordinating and subordinating conjunction distinction. To test this question we compared Antithesis and Concession to Contrast. The results are in Table 2 . The rst thing to notice is that but and too are no longer signicant: they mark Antithesis and Concession equally as well as they mark Contrast. We also see that a number of markers that were useful for distinguishing Contrast from Cause-Eect relations are also useful for distinguishing Antithesis and Concession from Contrast, occurring signicantly more often in Antithesis and Concession, i.e. though, although, despite, even, still and while. What if we instead group the three relations by the way in which they seem to establish contrast? Remember, from the denitions Concession has to do with a violated expectation between the two discourse units, whereas both Contrast and Antithesis should be characterized by a comparison along `one or more respects'.  A second result is that by using \u03c7 2 statistics to identify discourse markers we have a reliable and fairly automatic alternative method to the intuitive identication of markers made by much of the existing research. This method can be applied to other discourse relations and may nd some surprising results, such as e.g. our nding that however is not a reliable unambiguous marker of Contrast when compared with Cause-Eect relations. Of course, it is entirely possible that however is a good indicator of Contrast when distinguishing Contrast from e.g. Narration. Ideally, we should compare all combinations to derive an exhaustive and data derived list of reliable discourse markers for all relations, but we limit our discussion to a small set of lexical items and only compare Contrast with Cause-Eect relations because of time and space constraints, but this is an obvious next step in our inquiry. Our results have implications for data oriented approaches using intuition to identify markers to extract examples of coherence relations. Marcu and Echihabi [2002] for example relied solely on discourse markers to extract training data, necessarily so because the method they used requires more data than could feasibly be manually annotated. But our results show that careful testing of the reliability of the discourse markers could improve the quality of the extracted relations. Further, the number of Contrast relations recognized has to be carefully considered. Treating all Contrast relations as one supercategory, collapsing the RST distinctions as Marcu and Echihabi [2002] and many others have done, may lead to worse results than retaining the distinctions; we know from part of speech tagging for example, that while too many distinctions may make tagging harder, too few can do the same. The results also show that even a modest amount of annotated data can be useful for improving extracted data. Finally, one of the most obvious problems with all the studies (including this one) on automatically identifying discourse relations is that they only work with marked discourse relations. Our results won't help much in identifying unmarked Contrast relations, yet these relations are very frequent. Carlson et al. [2003] have shown that in the corpus of Rhetorical Structure trees only 61 out of 238 contrast relations were marked by a discourse marker. This means that contrastive markers would help to identify only 25% of contrast relations in that corpus. Similarly, Taboada [2006] looked at the RST corpus and a task-oriented dialogue corpus and concluded that most of the relations (between 60-70%) were not signaled by any discourse markers. Finding a solution to these problems will be a challenge for future work.
