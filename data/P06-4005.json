Introduction Recently, biomedical researchers have been facing the vast repository of research papers, e.g. MEDLINE. These researchers are eager to search biomedical correlations such as protein-protein or gene-disease associations. The use of natural language processing technology is expected to reduce their burden, and various attempts of information extraction using NLP has been being made (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Hao et al., 2005; Chun et al., 2006) . However, the framework of traditional information retrieval (IR) has difficulty with the accurate retrieval of such relational concepts. This is because relational concepts are essentially determined by semantic relations of words, and keyword-based IR techniques are insufficient to describe such relations precisely. This paper proposes a practical HPSG parser for English, Enju, an intelligent search engine for the accurate retrieval of relational concepts from Enju: An English HPSG Parser We developed an English HPSG parser, Enju 1 (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005; Hara et al., 2005; Ninomiya et al., 2005) . (Hara et al., 2005) . The GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005) consists of 500 abstracts (4,446 sentences) extracted from MEDLINE. Figure 1 shows a part of the parse tree and fea- MEDIE: a search engine for MEDLINE Figure 2 shows the top page of the MEDIE. ME-DIE is an intelligent search engine for the accurate retrieval of relational concepts from MED-LINE 2 (Miyao et al., 2006) . Prior to retrieval, all sentences are annotated with predicate argument structures and ontological identifiers by applying Enju and a term recognizer. Automatically Annotated Corpus First, we applied a POS analyzer and then Enju. The POS analyzer and HPSG parser are trained by using the GENIA corpus (Tsuruoka et al., 2005; Hara et al., 2005) , which comprises around 2,000 MEDLINE abstracts annotated with POS and Penn Treebank style syntactic parse trees (Tateisi et al., 2005) . The HPSG parser generates parse trees in a stand-off format that can be converted to XML by combining it with the original text. We also annotated technical terms of genes and diseases in our developed corpus. Technical terms are annotated simply by exact matching of dictio-2 http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medie/ nary entries and the terms separated by space, tab, period, comma, hat, colon, semi-colon, brackets, square brackets and slash in MEDLINE. The entire dictionary was generated by applying the automatic generation method of name variations (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2004) to the GENA dictionary for the gene names (Koike and Takagi, 2004) and the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) meta-thesaurus for the disease names (Lindberg et al., 1993) . It was generated by applying the name-variation generation method, and we obtained 4,467,855 entries of a gene and disease dictionary. Functions of MEDIE MEDIE provides three types of search, semantic search, keyword search, GCL search. GCL search provides us the most fundamental and powerful functions in which users can specify the boolean relations, linear order relation and structural relations with variables. Trained users can enjoy all functions in MEDIE by the GCL search, but it is not easy for general users to write appropriate queries for the parsed corpus. The semantic search enables us to specify an event verb with its subject and object easily. MEDIE automatically generates the GCL query from the semantic query, and runs the GCL search. Figure 3 shows the output of semantic search for the query 'What disease does dystrophin cause?'. This example will give us the most intuitive understandings of the proximal and structural retrieval with a richly annotated parsed corpus. MEDIE retrieves sentences which include event verbs of 'cause' and noun 'dystrophin' such that 'dystrophin' is the subject of the event verbs. The event verb and its subject and object are highlighted with designated colors. As seen in the figure, small sentences in relative clauses, passive forms or coordination are retrieved. As the objects of the event verbs are highlighted, we can easily see what disease dystrophin caused. As the target corpus is already annotated with diseases entities, MEDIE can efficiently retrieve the disease expressions. Info-PubMed: a GUI-based MEDLINE search tool Info-PubMed is a MEDLINE search tool with GUI, helping users to find information about biomedical entities such as genes, proteins, and Info-PubMed provides information from MED-LINE on protein-protein interactions. Given the name of a gene or protein, it shows a list of the names of other genes/proteins which co-occur in sentences from MEDLINE, along with the frequency of co-occurrence. Co-occurrence of two proteins/genes in the same sentence does not always imply that they interact. For more accurate extraction of sentences that indicate interactions, it is necessary to identify relations between the two substances. We adopted PASs derived by Enju and constructed extraction patterns on specific verbs and their arguments based on the derived PASs (Yakusiji, 2006) . Functions of Info-PubMed In the 'Gene Searcher' window, enter the name of a gene or protein that you are interested in. For example, if you are interested in Raf1, type \"raf1\" in the 'Gene Searcher' (Figure 4 ). You will see a list of genes whose description in our dictionary contains \"raf1\" (Figure 5 ). Then, drag one of the GeneBoxes from the 'Gene Searcher' to the 'Interaction Viewer.' You will see a list of genes/proteins which co-occur in the same sentences, along with co-occurrence frequency. The GeneBox in the leftmost column is the one you have moved to 'Interaction Viewer.' The GeneBoxes in the second column correspond to gene/proteins which co-occur in the same sentences, followed by the boxes in the third column, InteractionBoxes. Drag an InteractionBox to 'ContentViewer' to see the content of the box (Figure 6 ). An In-teractionBox is a set of SentenceBoxes. A Sen-tenceBox corresponds to a sentence in MEDLINE in which the two gene/proteins co-occur. A Sen-tenceBox indicates whether the co-occurrence in the sentence is direct evidence of interaction or not. If it is judged as direct evidence of interaction, it is indicated as Interaction. Otherwise, it is indicated as Co-occurrence. Conclusion We presented an English HPSG parser, Enju, a search engine for relational concepts from MED-LINE, MEDIE, and a GUI-based MEDLINE search tool, Info-PubMed. MEDIE and Info-PubMed demonstrate how the results of deep parsing can be used for intelligent text mining and semantic information retrieval in the biomedical domain.
