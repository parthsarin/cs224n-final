    "article": "Definition Extraction (DE) and terminology are contributing to help structuring the overwhelming amount of information available. This article presents KESSI (Knowledge Extraction System for Scientific Interviews), a multilingual domainindependent machine-learning approach to the extraction of definitional knowledge, specifically oriented to scientific interviews. The DE task was approached as both a classification and a sequential labelling task. In the latter, figures of Precision, Recall and F-Measure were similar to human annotation, and suggest that combining structural, statistical and linguistic features with Conditional Random Fields can contribute significantly to the development of DE systems. Introduction We present and discuss the process of building and evaluating a DE system for educational purposes. Aimed at exploiting the genre of scientific interviews, and envisaged as a time-saving tool for semi-automatically creating listening comprehension exercises, we present a Knowledge Extraction System for Scientific Interviews (KESSI). It is based on the theoretical and methodological foundations of DE, the task to automatically identify definitional sentences within texts (Navigli and Velardi, 2010) . KESSI is a DE system that relies solely on machine-learning techniques, which has the advantage of overcoming the domain-specificity and language dependence of rule-based methods (Del Gaudio et al., 2013) . In order to train and test our model, the SMPoT (Science Magazine Podcast Transcripts) corpus was compiled and annotated with linguistic, terminologic and definitional information. Two main contributions emerge from the work here presented. Firstly, it provides an analysis and discussion of the genre of scientific interviews, and examines its potential for NLP applications. We hypothesize that these interviews constitute a valuable source of information, as many scientific disciplines are covered, but dealt with in a standard register rather than the highly formal and structured register of technical manuals or scientific papers or books. Scientific interviews also present the audience with turntaking, courtesy and pragmatic elements that can prove useful for linguistic research as well as the development of Natural Language Processing tools. Secondly, promising results that border or go beyond 90% in Precision and Recall demonstrate that using CRF for DE is a viable option. These results also seem to suggest that combining linguistic information (surface forms, Part-of-Speech and syntactic functions), statistical information (word counts or tfidf) and structural information (position of the token within the document, or whether it is the interviewer or the interviewee who speaks) can contribute to the design of DE systems. Related Work It can be argued that in general, most approaches to automatic DE rely on rule-based methods. These have ranged from verb-matching (Rebeyrolle and Tanguy, 2000; Saggion and Gaizauskas, 2004; Sarmento et al., 2006; Storrer and Wellinghoff, 2006) to punctuation (Muresan and Klavans, 2002; Malais\u00e9 et al., 2004; S\u00e1nchez and M\u00e1rquez, 2005; Przepi\u00f3rkowski et al., 2007; Monachesi and Westerhout, 2008) or layout features (Westerhout, 2009) . It seems reasonable to argue that there are three main problems when approaching DE as a pattern-matching task (Del Gaudio et al., 2013) Who speaks We focus on who mentions the current token. In our example, the interviewee. Tf-Idf + surface form + lemma In a two-word window, we would retrieve features like [3.32 + lasts + essentially] or [3.64 + essentially + forever]. Note that it it is possible to retrieve features from instances that are after the current token. Table 1 : Some of the features used for training the CRF model. repeatedly in definitions. Secondly, these rules are language-dependent. Thirdly, they are also domain-dependent, making it difficult to extend them beyond the domain of application to which they were initially intended. In order to overcome these problems, machinelearning techniques can be incorporated to the process. The most widely used algorithms have been Na\u00efve Bayes, Maximum Entropy or Support Vector Machines, in the case of Fahmi and Bouma (2006) , Na\u00efve Bayes and Maximum Entropy (Rodr\u00edguez, 2004) , genetic algorithms (Borg, 2009) or balanced random forests, in Deg\u00f3rski et al. (2008a; 2008b) and Westerhout (2010) . Concerning unsupervised approaches, Zhang (2009) used a bootstrapping algorithm for the extraction of definitions in Chinese. The SMPoT Corpus: Compilation and Annotation We design a corpus following the criteria elicited by McEnery and Wilson (2001) . The corpus consists of 50 fully annotated interview transcripts. Preprocessing After manually downloading and converting the pdf files from the Science Magazine Website 1 , these were parsed using the dependency parser Machinese Syntax (Tapanainen and J\u00e4rvinen, 1997) . In this way, linguistic information such as lemma, Part-of-Speech, syntactic functions or a word's position in a dependency tree is provided. Once the documents were collected, converted, pre-processed and automatically parsed, the next step was to semi-automatically annotate the terminology. For this, we benefited from an API for Python of the Yahoo! Term Extractor (also known as Yahoo! Content Analysis 2 ). Terms were identified, and <Term></Term> tags were inserted to the xml document. Since terms can span multiple words, the <Term></Term> tags were introduced as parent nodes of the <token> tags. When queried, the Term Extractor API yields a list of terms, but its results depend on the size of the input text. This means that each document of the corpus had first to be split in sentences, and then each sentence was queried in order to preserve a high recall. Annotating Definitions This annotation schema builds up on previous work by Sierra et al. (2006) and Westerhout and Monachesi (2007) . It is argued that in a textual genre like scientific interviews, where a certain degree of specificity and technical jargon is present, a classification that looks at the patterns of the definitions alone, or at their information alone, might prove insufficient to capture the complexity of the way information is presented. Table 3 shows the 5 most frequent types of this two-dimensional classification, as well as their count and an example of each. So far, the annotation process (summarized in Figure 1 ) has been examined, which consisted in automatic linguistic markup, semi-automatic terminology identification, and manual definition labelling and classification. The Development of KESSI Once the dataset is compiled and enriched, and can be used for training and testing purposes, we approach the DE task as (1) a binary classification task, where each sentence is labeled as has def or no def, and (2) a sequential labeling task, where each token is tagged according to whether it is Inside, Outsideor at the Beginning of a definitional clause. Binary Classification Using the Weka workbench (Witten and Frank, 2005), we train a set of machine-learning algorithms in order to classify unseen sentences as containing or not containing a definition. However, a previous step seems necessary in order to handle properly the imbalanced dataset issue. According to Del Gaudio et al. ( 2013 ), few works have specifically addressed this issue through some kind of sampling. We take an approach similar to Deg\u00f3rski et al. (2008b) , where a number of subsampled training datasets are used to increase the ratio of positive instances, specifically 1:1, 2:1 and 5:1. Moreover, simple linguistically motivated features were used. We extracted the 500 most frequent ngrams (n = 1, 2, 3), and used the linguistic information provided by the parser. This resulted in 1-3grams for surface forms, Part-Of-Speech and syntactic functions. In addition, we also added pattern-based features, like the presence or absence of the sequence \"which is\" or having a term followed by the verb \"to be\". Finally, the algorithms selected were Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Sequential Labelling Building up on the premise that both linguistic and structural features can be exploited for automatic DE, we propose a method to label each token in a sequence with B DefClause, I DefClause or O DefClause tags (which correspond to whether a token is a the beginning, inside or outside a definition). For each sentence, each token has been manually annotated with these tags. Whenever a sequence of words that form a definition is found (what we refer as Definitional Clause), the tokens that are part of it are additionally labelled as Beginning, Inside or Outside for three more categories: Term, Definitional Verb and Definition. See Figure 2 for an illustrative example of this two-layered annotation schema. Conditional Random Fields Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty and McCallum, 2001) have been used extensively in NLP, e.g. (Fersini and Messina, 2013) , Sentiment Analysis (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010) or TimeML event recognition (Llorens et al., 2010) . They are undirected graphical models where the dependencies among input variables x do no need to be explicitly represented. This allows to use richer and more global features of the input data, e.g. features like Part-of-Speech or ngram features of surrounding words. Feature Selection The definition of features is crucial for the architecture of the system (Llorens et al., 2010) . We hypothesize that combining linguistic, statistic and structural information can contribute to the improvement of DE systems. For each token, these are the features extracted: \u2022 Term Frequency: Raw count for the current token within the document. \u2022 Tf-idf: Relative frequency score, which takes into account not only the token count within the current document, but its spread across the collection. \u2022 Token index: The position of the token in the document. \u2022 Is term: Whether the token is a term or not. \u2022 Surface form: The surface form of the token. \u2022 Lemma: The token's lemma. In the case of extremely highly collocated multiword units, Machinese Syntax groups them together in one token. They are left as-is, regardless of potential capitalization. \u2022 Part-of-Speech: Part-of-Speech of the token, including subtypes and number. \u2022 Syntactic Function: Following a dependency grammar. \u2022 Who speaks: Whether it is the interviewer, the interviewee, or a dangling token, in which case it is tagged as narrator. \u2022 BIO term: Regardless of the is term label, we also investigate the token's position within a term BIO tagging scheme. \u2022 BIO DefVerb: Labels the connecting verb between a term and a definition. \u2022 BIO Definition: Labels the chunk that constitutes actual the definition. Since CRF allow the encoding of long-distance relations, these features are combined in order to capture relevant combinations of features occurring before and after the current token (see Table 4 ). Evaluation The performance of KESSI was evaluated from two different perspectives. The reason for this being that it was necessary to account for the two approaches (binary classification and sequential labelling), on one hand, and the ultimate purpose of the system, on the other. Firstly, figures of Precision, Recall and F-Measure are provided and discussed for the classification approach, consider- Who speaks We focus on who mentions the current token. In our example, the interviewee. Tf-Idf + surface form + lemma In a two-word window, we would retrieve features like [3.32 + lasts + essentially] or [3.64 + essentially + forever]. Note that it it is possible to retrieve features from instances that are after the current token. Table 4 : Some of the features used for training the CRF model. ing different resampling setups as well as different algorithms. Finally, Precision, Recall a nd F-Measure are reported on a high-granularity basis, in a hard evaluation, where only exact matching of a token was considered a true positive. Classification Approach Firstly, we examine results obtained with a simple ngram feature selection, where the 500 most frequent surface form uni, bi and trigrams are used as features for each sentence vector. Subsampling was carried out because we were more interested in correctly extracting positive instances, i.e. increasing Recall in is def sentences. The highest F scores for positive instances were obtained under the following configurations: 1. Na\u00efve Bayes -Original Dataset 10-fold Cross validation 2. Decision Trees -Subsample 2:1 -Test on original dataset In setup (I), 207 positive instances out of 570 were correctly extracted, which yields a Recall of .36 for positive instances. However, by subsampling the training set to a 1:1 ratio (i.e. randomly removing negative instances until the remaining set contains the same number of positive and negative instances), it is possible to increase the desired results. As this approach cannot be tested by cross-validation, a supplied test set from the original dataset is used for testing. This test set did not overlap with the training set. In (II), Recall increases to up to .6, as the system correctly extracts 66 out of 110 positive instances. Precision, however, remains low (P = .16). By incorporating more features where POS and syntactic functions are combined, we increase We can conclude that combining surface form, Part-of-Speech and syntactic functions ngrams as features in a subsampled training set of 1:1 serves as the highest performing model. We consider a good model the one that correctly classifies the highest number of positive instances (i.e. those sentences that contain a definition), with the minimum loss with respect to negative instances. CRF Evaluation We propose a token-wise evaluation where each word is matched against the gold standard. If its BIO DefClause tag does not match, it is considered incorrect. This has the advantage of knowing beforehand how many tokens we have, which is crucial for being able to compute Precision, Recall and F-Measure. It could be argued, however, that such approach is too restrictive, as it will consider as incorrect a B DefClause token even if it is compared with an I DefClause token, and this might not be always as accurate. In Table 5 , the performance of KESSI is shown for three different sampling setups: Original train-set (Original), subsample of negative sentences down to 1000 (S-1000), and subsample of negative sentences down to 10000 (S-10000). For testing, a cut-off of the same size as in the Classification approach is used. Our test sets contain 20% of the overall positive instances, which in this case are either B DefClause or I DefClause tokens. This amounts to 111 definitions. Our test set consisted in, first, a dataset where all sentences are split according to their original format (All-S), and second, a dataset where all the instances are put together with no sentence boundary among them (1-S). These results reveal that a radical resampling (leaving only 1000 negative instances), when using Conditional Random Fields, does not have a dramatic effect in performance. While Recall increases almost a 10% (from 0.89 to 0.98), Precision suffers from a strong decrease, in this case 94% (from 0.97 to 0.03). With scores nearing or above 90% in Precision, Recall and F-Measure, it seems safe to assume that using linguistic, statistic and structural features combined with CRF improve dramatically a DE system. In comparison with previous work in this field, where most datasets consisted in more structured text than interview transcripts, it also seems reasonable to claim that this method is better suited for more unstructured language. Conclusions Different stages involved in the design and development of a DE system have been presented. Once the criteria for the taxonomy were clear, an annotation task was carried out on 50 documents from The Science Magazine Podcast, where linguistic information, terminology and definitions were identified and classified. Then, the DE task was approached both as a classification problem and as a sequential labelling problem, and Precision, Recall and F-Measure results indicate that combining linguistic, structural and statistic features with Conditional Random Fields can lead to high performance. We propose the following directions for future work: Firstly, expanding the size and the dataset and incorporating additional features to the definition classification. Secondly, trying additional resampling techniques like the SMOTE algorithm in order to oversample the minority class. This algorithm has been applied successfully in this field (Del Gaudio et al., 2013) . Thirdly, ensuring a more reliable annotation by incorporating additional annotators and computing some kind of agreement metric would seem advisable as in some cases a false positive might be due to the fact that the annotator missed a good definition. And finally, providing sentence-wise evaluation scores for the CRF approach, so that the two methods showcased could be evenly compared.",
