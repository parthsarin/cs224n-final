    "article": "We describe a topic model based approach for selectional preference. Using the topic features generated by an LDA model on the extracted predicate-arguments over the Chinese Gigaword corpus, we show improvement to our state-of-the-art Chinese SRL system by 2.34 F1 points on arguments of nominal predicates, 0.40 F1 point on arguments of verb predicates, and 0.66 F1 point overall. More over, similar gains were achieved on out-ofgenre test data, as well as on English SRL using the same technique. Introduction It's long been theorized that selectional preferences (SP)/semantic constraints can improve automatic semantic role labeling (SRL). And while there have been several publications showing positive effects of SP, the evaluations have been dominated by pseudodisambiguation. Zapirain et al. (2013) demonstrated end-to-end SRL improvement on arguments of English verb predicates by using a combination of lexical resources and distributional similarity based SP. However, the margin of improvement is a modest 0.4 F1 point (on WSJ) over a baseline system with performance over 4 F1 points lower than the top system in CoNLL-2005 (Carreras and M\u00e0rquez, 2005) . These results may not be convincing enough to motivate the incorporation of SP when building an SRL system. One reason for the small improvement may be that arguments of a verb predicate are highly constrained by the underlying syntactic parse, and SP features that could disambiguate between role types are often negated by parse errors. With the recent extension of PropBank SRL to nominal and adjective predicates, preposition relationships, light-verb constructions, and abstract meaning representation (Bonial et al., 2014; Banarescu et al., 2013) , it may be time to revisit SP for SRL. We hypothesize that SP will provide a greater benefit to nominal SRL, especially on a language with lower parsing accuracy. In this paper, we apply SP to Chinese SRL (which has few morphological clues that impacts parsing accuracy) for arguments of both verb and nominal predicates using Chinese Gigaword. Our hypothesis, that SP will provide a greater benefit for nominal predicates than for verbal predicates, is verified by our results. We achieve a 2.34 F1 point improvement to our Chinese SRL system on arguments of nominal predicates, 0.40 F1 point on arguments of verb predicates, and 0.66 F1 point overall. Previous Work on Selectional Preference Inducing selectional preferences from corpus data was first proposed by Resnik (1997) for sense disambiguation. He generalized seen words using the WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) hierarchy. Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) applied SP to automatic SRL by clustering extracted verb-direct object pairs, resulting in modest improvements. This syntactic signature based selectional preference technique has also been successfully extended and applied to unsupervised SRL by Lang and Lapata (2011) (using splitmerge role clustering), as well as Titov and Klementiev (2012) (using a distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process prior for role clustering). Zapirain et al. (2013) improved the end-to-end perfor-mance of an English PropBank SRL system by 0.4 F1 points using a variety of word similarity measures, from WordNet hierarchy distance to distributional similarity measures. Ritter and Etzioni (2010) reasoned that the set of hidden variables modeled by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) naturally represents the semantic structure of a document collection, and the topics generated can be viewed as the latent set of classes that store preferences. The work utilizes LinkLDA, a variant of the standard LDA that models two sets of distributions for each topic simultaneously, with the resulting topics encoding the mutual constraints of a pair of arguments for the same predicate. S\u00e9aghdha and Korhonen (2014) also proposed SP w/ the LDA variants ROOTH-LDA and LEX-LDA. There has also been work on Chinese selectional preferences, both lexical resource (HowNet) based and corpus based (Jia et al., 2011; Jia et al., 2013) . The authors found the LDA corpus based SP improved over the HowNet based SP on pseudodisambiguation. All of these results encouraged us to also attempt an LDA based approach to SP. 3 Selectional Preference for SRL 3.1 SP Representation Some of the most discriminative SP models used by Zapirain et al. (2013) relied on distributional similarity computed over dependency relationships (provided by Lin (1998) ). For example, in \"John lent Mary the book.\", we would extract John-nsubj, Mary-iobj, book-dobj for the predicate lend. While this has proven to be of higher quality than pure word co-occurrence based similarity, it may not be optimal for semantic-based processing. With nominal SRL, a large portion of the arguments (around 50% in Chinese PropBank) are not the direct syntactic dependents of the predicate: in figure 1 , because of a light verb-like construction, all the arguments of \u6b22\u8fce/welcome are the syntactic dependents of \u8868 \u793a/express. To address this, we directly extract SP of the predicates by running our SRL system over the unannotated corpus. For our example, we would extract John-Arg0, Mary-Arg2, book-Arg1 for lend. SP with LDA-based Topic Model Our approach to modeling selectional preferences (SP) follows a relatively straightforward application of LDA to a set of predicate-argument instances derived from a corpus. In the standard LDA model, a document d is represented by a bag of words and is drawn from a multi-nominal Dirichlet \u03b8 d over topics. The resulting model is a probability distribution of each word amongst the topics. For the SRL application, we treat each extracted argument (represented by the (label, headword) pair) as a \"word\", and the collection of arguments for all instances of a particular predicate as a \"document\". The generated topics would then contain arguments sharing a similar set of predicates. With this definition, we allow different role labels to share the same topic (though it does not encode role constraints quite like LinkLDA, ROOTH-LDA, etc). For prepositional phrases, we used the dependent of the preposition as the head word since the preposition can often be omitted in Chinese. SRL Filtering Building selectional preferences by means of using the output of an SRL system is unlikely to improve the same SRL system unless one filters out the lower quality labels (in earlier experiments where we performed no filtering, this was indeed the case). We ran SRL on the unannotated corpus using a logistic regression model and filtered out the low probability output. To balance between precision and recall, we set a hard 0.5 probability cutoff and discounted the occurrences of the rest using the label probability. Since we can extract higher quality SP from the output of a better performing SRL system, we can iteratively improve our SRL system by re-extracting SP using a retrained (SP enhanced) SRL system. We arrived at diminishing returns after one additional iteration (of training SRL, extracting SP, and retraining SRL w/ new SP). SRL Implementation Our Chinese SRL system follows the standard (English) approach where the SRL task is posed as a multi-class classification problem requiring the identification of argument candidates for each predicate and their argument types using a set of lexical Figure 1 : Chinese nominal predicate translated to English verb predicate and syntactic features (predicate word, constituent head, path, syntactic frame, etc). While the top SRL systems from CoNLL-2005 1 and some subsequent systems use multiple parses for structural inference, we instead implement a 2-stage argument label classification system on a single input parse: the argument set found by the first classifier is used as an additional feature for the second classifier (to identify missing or duplicate argument label types). Selectional Preference The LDA topic model produces a probability distribution of words (represented here by the (label, headword) pair) over topics. For the SRL task, argument candidates with topic distributions similar to those of the arguments found in the training set are likely to be permissible. Ideally, we would use these distributions directly. Since our SRL system was designed to accept lexical (binary) features only (for training/decoding performance), we pared the distribution down to at most 3 topics for each label type and excluded words that do not have high affinity to a few topics (sum of the probability of the top 3 topics < 50%) to prevent diluting the discriminative power of the topic feature. We used the resulting list of (label, topic id) pairs for each word as the selectional preference feature for each encountered constituent in the Chinese SRL system. During the normal LDA inference stage, using the learned topic model, a predicate instance (\"document\") will be assigned a probability distribution over topics based on its arguments, and each argument will be assigned a specific topic (or topic distribution). This could further constrain an argument's selectional preference within the context of the predicate instance and other arguments. For our system, we experimented with performing inference on the argument label set extracted from the first stage classifier and using the constrained argument topic dis-tribution for the second stage classifier. However, we observed no improvement, likely because there are only a few arguments for each predicate instance. Experiment Setup Our Chinese SRL system is trained on Chinese Tree-Bank 5.1 and Chinese PropBank 1.0. We used the standard: sections 81-885 for training, sections 41-80 for development, and sections 1-40, 900-931 for testing. We generated the training parses (with 10 fold cross-validation) and the test parses using the Berkeley parser 2 (5 split-merge cycles). The parser F1 score on the test sections is 82.73 as measured by ParseEval (Black et al., 1991) . We prepared the Chinese Gigaword 3 corpus with the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter 4 . We performed LDA topic modeling using PLDA+ (Liu et al., 2011) and the recommended \u03b1 = 50/topic cnt, \u03b2 = 0.01 values. We chose 2000 topics (tuned on the SRL performance of the development set rather than any topic based metrics). Table 1 lists some of the found topics (with the most frequent, relatively interesting, and least frequent headword, label pairs) using Chinese Gigaword. Performance As table 2 shows, the addition of the SP feature improved nominal SRL by 2.34 F1 points. Verb SRL improved by 0.40 F1 point and overall SRL improved by 0.66 F1 point. These F1 differences were all found to be statistically significant 5 (p \u2264 0.05). We also tested the system on Sinorama magazine and other out-of-genre sections (broadcast conversation, broadcast news, web blog) in Chinese Prop- 3 shows, even though the absolute performance is much lower, SP improved the precision and recall in all cases, the nominal SRL score on Sinorama by 2.30 F1 points, and verb SRL score by 0.31-0.46 F1 point. Again, these F1 differences were statistically significant. Comparison Direct performance comparison with previous Chinese SRL systems is a bit difficult: Xue (2008) , Zhuang and Zong (2010) trained the syntactic parsers with an additional 250K word broadcast news corpus found in Chinese TreeBank 6.0, while Sun (2010) only reported results using gold POS tags but no additional gold parses. However, as table 4 shows, for verb predicates, our system bests Xue's (2008) system by 4-7 F1 points with less parser training data and when tested with (but was not retrained to take full advantage of) gold POS tags besting Sun's (2010) system by 0.53 F1 point. For nominal predicates, our system bests Xue's ( 2008 ) system, by 1.9 F1 points on arguments of nominal predicates (since we have an integrated SRL system, the results are obtained by training both verb and nominal predicates, then using only the nominal classifier to classify the nominal predicates). English SRL We applied the same techniques to English SRL using the English Gigaword 7 corpus. We used 800 topics (w/ lemmatized headwords) tuning on the 5 ), our SP approach had a smaller (but still statistically significant) absolute F1 gain, with most of the gain coming from core argument type improvements. But with a much higher performing baseline system (one of the highest reported results using a single input parse per sentence), the error reduction rate is comparable. Conclusion We presented a LDA topic model based selectional preference approach to improving automatic SRL. Using SP extracted from a 63.6M sentence Chinese Gigaword corpus, we were able to improve on the results of an already competitive Chinese SRL system by 2.34 F1 points on nominal predicates, 0.40 F1 point on verb predicates, and 0.66 F1 point on the standard test set. More over, we obtained comparable improvement on out-of-genre data and demonstrated our technique is also applicable to English SRL. Given the margin of improvement on nominal SRL, which is not as well constrained by syntax as verb SRL, there are reasons to speculate the proposed technique could be applicable to other predicate type extensions of PropBank SRL. As our first attempt at automatically deriving Chinese selectional preference, there is a lot of room for future improvement. Notably, these include techniques used for English SP such as computing similarity based on lexical resources (for Chinese -HowNet (Dong et al., 2010) ), distributional similarity, latent word language model (Deschacht and Moens, 2009) , different variants of LDA topic models, as well as taking advantages of argument constraints in parallel corpora to extract higher quality SP.
