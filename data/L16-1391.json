Introduction The Constitution of South Africa makes provision for 11 official languages, which comprise English, Afrikaans, isiZulu, isiXhosa, Siswati, isiNdebele, Sesotho, Setswana, Sesotho sa Lebowa (Northern Sotho), Tshivenda and Xitsonga. Figure 1 below depicts the balance between the different languages: Apart from English, all of the other languages are regarded as resource scarce languages. This obviously calls for actions to develop resources for these languages, preferably in a coordinated and systematic manner. Building a resource infrastructure In 2008 a proposal to establish a National Centre for Human Technologies (HLT) was approved by Cabinet of National Government with the intent, inter alia, to develop applicable language resources. In practice, this became a virtual (administrative) centre under the auspices of the HLT Unit within the Department of Arts and Culture (DAC). A ministerial expert panel on HLT (HLTEP) currently assists the HLT Unit to develop strategic plans and fund development projects in the HLT domain. As funding for HLT projects became available from the DAC and also from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), the necessity for a central repository for reusable language resources became crucial. In 2012 the DAC then set up a language Resource Management Agency (RMA) which is currently being run by the Centre for Text Technology (CTexT \u00a9 ) at the North-West University in Potchefstroom (http://www.rma.nwu.ac.za). Since its inception four years ago, the RMA has shown significant growth in the number of clients and in the distribution of language resources, including applicable software for various applications. This includes: 3. \uf0b7 Structure and function of SADiLaR Structurally this new facility comprises a hub-and-spoke model linking three academic institutions, an interuniversity partnership (including two more universities) and an institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as nodes, with the North-West University (NWU) as coordinator of an independent freestanding hub: The institutions referred to in more detail below, have taken the initial lead in setting up this national facility with the idea to create more nodes as activities increase and other institutions or groups join up. The SADiLaR hub will formally function as a hosted research entity within the NWU, and will have its own management structure, including a board representing existing and potential role players in the South African context, as well as an international scientific advisory committee (SAC). The founding members of this initiative all have a record in the field of language resource and language technology developments and comprises: The Centre for Text Technology (CTexT \u00ae ) linked to the Research Unit for Language and Literatures in the South African Context at the NWU: This entity currently manages the RMA which will be integrated in SADiLaR. The Centre has been involved in major resource and software developments related to the official languages over the last decade as may be observed in the website, http://www.nwu.ac.za/ctext. The Department of African Languages at the University of South Africa (UNISA): This department with its 30 full time staff members represent expertise in all nine official African languages of South Africa. Over and above language content capabilities, the department also has proven expertise in computational applications in African languages. UNISA being a correspondence university, is also extremely well positioned to provide training and upgrading of skills in various domains linked to this initiative. (http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent& ContentID=143). The Department of African Languages at the University of Pretoria (UP): Over at least the last two decades this department has been highly involved in different kinds of data collection particularly related to lexicographic and terminological developments in the African languages. The department has particular skills in statistical assessment of large data corpora which underpins the development dictionaries and domain specific terminologies. The content of its current language archive will easily be accessed through the envisaged national infrastructure, opening up the data to national and international communities on a more formal basis. (http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=482 of digital texts written by university students at different levels as part of academic literacy programs. This data, when made accessible on a national level will not only contribute to an understanding of the nature of language acquisition and performance, but also to the design of software for language testing and remediation. The above mentioned formal partners (Fig. 2 ) will each have a senior researcher functioning as a node manager who will have an oversight function regarding the activities assigned to the particular node. Given that it is foreseen that the Centre will have a life span of at least fifteen years, provision has been made for career paths for 11 researchers (representative of each language), a senior research manager and a technical manager, over and above positions for computational linguists and software developers under the supervision of an executive director. Provision is also made for internships and postdoctoral researchers to contribute to the digital development of the official languages of the country. 4. Focus of the Centre A percentage of the digitisation development budget will be allocated to approved proposals from the broader humanities and social science sector. Digitisation will commence with a focus on existing academically valuable non-digitised language related resources, followed by the systematic gathering of language data from various domains on a continuous basis. Over and above the digitisation projects run by the nodes, the systematic development of digital language resources will also be linked to post-graduate academic training where data obtained by scholars will be deposited in the Centre. For example, studies on topics related to the development of child language within, and across the official languages, will provide a wide range of digital speech data to be collated at the Centre. The same applies for data collected digitally in dialect, gender and sociolinguistic studies, as further examples. Ample funding and digital equipment will be available to post-graduate students from any university to gather data, which in turn will populate a matrix comprising languages on the X-level and language varieties/modes on the Y-level. The eventual availability of digital data in a populated matrix will enable new students to embark on related projects with at least some digital data as a point of reference. The use and application of these resources will be assessed as a long term metric. This program will be the responsibility of the Manager: Technology. Digital Humanities program: Given the relatively slow uptake of digital methods and digital data in research in the humanities and social sciences (HSS) in South Africa, this Centre intends playing a major facilitating role in promoting DH practice in research. This will include training of researchers and students on methodological issues related to the use of digital tools, large data sets, the interpretation of results and the representation thereof in research projects. Although the main focus will be on language as the carrier of information, the initial scope of the training will include subjects and topics in the humanities and social sciences at large. This entails the implementation of dedicated awareness campaigns and training programs related to language technologies and/or digital methods in HSS research at tertiary institutions. It is necessary to stimulate interest and build capacity in the domain of natural language processing (especially regarding African languages) and hence special workshops will be organised within the tertiary sector at venues across the country. Furthermore, given that academic capacity in the domain of DH in South Africa is still very limited, appropriate national and international experts will be invited to take part in this awareness campaign and training program for at least the first 12 months after establishment of the Centre. Details on these programs, and calls for international participation will be made public soon after the establishment of the Centre. Services and products The Centre will provide the following services: Digitisation service: Quality controlled digitisation of language resources (text and speech: fully or partially annotated) for use by researchers and/or commercial entities (under licence conditions). This will include \uf0b7 academically valuable non-digitised language (text and speech) resources as determined by the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) to be digitised on a continuous basis; \uf0b7 new resources developed by the official partners as annual projects approved by the SAC; \uf0b7 new resources developed by academic communities / individuals responding to open calls for short term projects approved by SAC or delegated committee. Information sharing and resource distribution service: A multi-purpose on-line Portal making provision for \uf0b7 a catalogue of South African digital language resources available at the Centre with terms and conditions of use specified; \uf0b7 an inventory of all digital language resources under development at the Centre; \uf0b7 an inventory of all software tools available at the Centre for use; \uf0b7 on-line links to national and international resource centres; \uf0b7 on-line distribution of digital language resources and software tools. These two services mentioned above will provide researchers and students alike with large volumes of resources that were not previously accessible, and will allow for credible quantitative as well as qualitative interpretations. The availability of software tools to extract information, organise and visualise results in various ways bring new dimensions to research in the domain of HSS. Archival language search service: Given that in-house data management tools and procedures will be in place, searches for specific types of data within and across databases will be available for users without them having to download large databases. This will be an on-line service to end-users which will initially be conducted manually. However, this service could in the future be fully automated providing users access to current and historic language forms. This will be a unique service especially as far as it concerns African languages, whilst simultaneously constituting a living archive of the languages at different points in time. Academic leadership services: In addition to these services the Centre will provide academic research leadership within the domain of Digital Humanities (DH) as previously described. This will initially be available as a service to the wider South African academic community. The Centre will continue and expand on the provision of the following products: Annotated digital speech datasets in all 11 official languages in different modalities, e.g. as \uf0b7 natural speech in different environments (noisy, clear, studio quality, telephone speech etc. ) \uf0b7 natural speech of different age groups (children to aged subjects) \uf0b7 natural gender based speech \uf0b7 natural speech in different dialects \uf0b7 impaired speech (to follow at a later stage with cooperation of speech therapists) Marked up digital text datasets in all 11 official languages comprising \uf0b7 running texts of different genres: newsfeed, novels, dramas, poetry, advertisements, websites etc. \uf0b7 language learner corpora \uf0b7 sms-texts \uf0b7 parallel text corpora These datasets are necessary for, inter alia, the development of dictionaries and coining of new terminologies, language use in academic literacy studies, sentiment analysis, manual as well as machine translation systems, interpretation studies, intelligent information retrieval systems, etc. Natural language software processing tools applicable to all official languages, given that some of the African languages, for instance, have conjunctive or disjunctive writing systems, posing a challenge to morphological parsing. High level training packages in principles and methods of research and development within a digital paradigm. This will include \uf0b7 workshops at the hub \uf0b7 workshops at the different nodes \uf0b7 workshops at any other university responding to open invitations. These workshops will be directed towards academic staff and students, government officials involved in language based services (e.g. staff of departmental language offices), members of the National Lexicographic Units, freelance translators and interpreters etc. National and international cooperation The Centre will be the first of its kind in the African context and is a multipartner language resource centre providing single sign-on access to a web based platform which integrates language-based resources and advanced tools for research and training related to all official languages of South Africa. This shall be implemented by shared responsibilities of partners as drivers of individual nodes. The Centre will actively market multilingual digital language resources for national and international research, training and commercial purposes. It will interact with similar international centres especially regarding best practices and knowledge transfer. The Centre will also formally link data to reputable centres in order to provide the international research community access to local language data, whilst simultaneously also getting access to language resources and software tools developed internationally. This research and development centre combines research expertise and essential technical and administrative support to conduct cutting-edge research in text and speech technology, and use that as the basis for the development of innovative and relevant technological applications. The Centre also ensures long-term sustainability for research and development activities, which is ideal for the establishment of valuable partnerships with industrial and business partners. Impact The South African National Centre for Digital Language Resources covers a variety of fields within and across languages and associated technologies, and provides resources for language based research and development in the humanities and social sciences, the typical domain of Digital Humanities. Furthermore the Centre has an enabling function to stimulate the development of language based software applications and tools for use in translation, education, social services, health promotion and issues that are relevant in the local environment. The Centre provides, with the support of business partners, appropriate capacity building programs related to methodological aspects of digitisation and the use of digital media in research and development projects. This Centre with its focus digitisation and the use of digital resources is a realistic response to the numerous challenges of a country dealing with 11 official languages.
