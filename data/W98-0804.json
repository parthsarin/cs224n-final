Further developments oriented to recognition can imply addition of rules to account for Latin American pronunciations (especially Mexican, Argentinian and Paraguayan); for synthesis, on the other hand, rules to represent coarticulatory phenomena at word boundaries can be implemented, in order to transcribe whole sentences. Introduction Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is an important prerequisite for many applicalions involving speech synthesis and recognition [I] . Large corpora used for these applications (e.g. WSJ, CMU, Oxford Pronunciation Dictionary, ONOMASTICA, SpeechDat) include phonetic transcriptions for both standard pronunciations and for variants, which can represent either differences in dialectal or individual realisation of single words (intra-word variants) [2, 3] or variations in the standard form produced by coarticulation between words (inter-word variants) [4] . These alternative pronuciations have been shown to improve recognition accuracy [5] and they need to be present in large phonetic database: the variants can either be realised manually on the basis of expert phonetic knowledge, or by a rulebased system. However, maintenace of such systems is complex, because insertion of new rules often causes to change the overall performance of the module. Therefore, new techniques to derive automatically rules for vapheme-to-phoneme conversion from training data have been investigated. Generally rules are obtained through forced recognition, according to the following procedure: 1) aligning of the canonical pronunciation to the alternative ones by means of a dynamic programming algorithm, in order to generate an aligned database 2) use this database to train a statistical model or a binary decision tree to generate variants of words or proper names [1] [3] [6] [5] or to model contextdependent variations at word boundary [4] ; neural networks can also be used to generate variants in pronunciation of words [2] or of surnames [7] , on the basis of pre-aligned or nonaligned training data [8] . Finally, a mixed approach combining knowledge obtained fi'om training data and a priori phonetic expertise has also been experimented to derive possible nonnative pronunciations of English and Italian words [9] . All these techniques have proven to be very effective to generate plausible alternatives to canonical ones. However, rule-based approaches can still represent an effective tool to automatically obtain standard transcriptions of large corpora built ad hoc for special applications, in particular oriented to synthesis: a letter-tophone rules component is very suitable to represent allophonic and allomorphic variations [10] [11] [12] which are essential to allow segmentation and diphone extraction from an acoustic database [ 13] . The rule system described in the present paper was developed on the basis of phonetic knowledge [14] [15] and has two different application domains, which imply different transcription requirements: the recogniser for Spanish uses sub-word units [16] [17] linked to the phonetic representation of isolated words; the units have been trained on the corpus of words extracted from the phonetically balanced sentences included in the SpeechDat database. Therefore, the SpeechDat corpus has been considered as the reference set of words that the conversion rules minimally had to correctly transcribe. Only isolated words were used, with the same phoneme inventory employed in the original SpeechDat transcriptions, including no allophones. On the other hand, the corpus for synthesis was selected to collect speech material to train the automatic phonetic aligner, in order to extract diphones for a concatenative synthesis system [18] and had to meet different requirements: a) units were to be pronounced both in isolated words and in sentences b) the phoneme inventory had to include the maximum number of allophones so to allow to build a representative acoustic dictionary containing occurences of all units and sequences in every appropriate segmental and prosodic context (stressed and unstressed syllables; initial and final position in the syllable; initial, internal and final position in the sentence; short and long sentences). Therefore, two partially different sets of rules have been designed for synthesis and recognition, which can be alternatively activated: the latter are a subset of the former. Both systems provide only one variant in output, i.e. the standard Castilian (Madrid) Spanish pronunciation. Orthographic and phonetic symbols The orthographic string in input is preprocessed to avoid problems relative to the configuration of the operating system: at this stage, letters with diacritics (corresponding to non-standard ASCII characters) can either be represented by means of extended ASCII (e.g. 'fi' = ext. ASCII code 241) or they can be converted into a sequence of standard ASCII symbols ('n ~' = st. ASCII 110+126). This preprocessing is common to both the recognition and the synthesis systems. The phonetic symbols used for recognition represent the 30 basic Spanish phones, which are also common to synthesis. For this latter system, however, 11 extra symbols have also been added to represent a set of allophones of the standard Spanish which show an acoustic structure clearly differentiated from the rest of already included allophones. These symbols represent stressed vowels, semivowels (i.e. [i] and [u] allophones in second position of falling diphthongs, distinguished from semi-consonants, or glides, i. e. [i] and [u] allophones in first position of rising diphthongs), the nasal labiodental allophone [n]], the palatal voiced stop ~], which accounts for the distribution of the palatal voiced approximant [j], in initial position or after T or 'n'(e.g. 'conyuge' = [k \"o Gn J u x e]) and the interdentat voiced fricative [.6], which accounts for the distribution of the the unvoiced interdental fricative [9] , in end of syllable before a voiced consonant (e.g. 'llovizna' [L o. B'i Zh. n a]). Finally, two phones typical of most frequent foreign loan words, i.e. the unvoiced dental affricate [ts] (e.g. 'pizza') and the unvoiced palatal fricative [J] (e.g. 'flash') were added. This gives a final set of 43 synthesis symbols. Front vowels Rule component The rule module is composed by a) table look-ups containing pre-stressed roots with hiatuses and words that do not take stress within a sentence b) stress assignment rules c) transcription rules. Vowels are transcribed before consonants. The main complexity in vowel conversion consists in disambiguation of diphthongs and hiatuses: stress position is crucial for correct transcription of these vowel sequences. However, in the rule component, they undergo a different treatment for recognition and synthesis, which is illustrated in the following, before a description of the consonant rules. Most of these transcriptions are incorrect from a linguistic point of view, but they are functional to the recognizer they are designed for, which does not distinguish semi-vowels from full vowels, and unstressed vowels from stressed ones. Diphthongs and hiatuses rules Synthesis However, correct rendition of hiatuses and diphthongs is crucial for synthesis, in order to select appropriate correspondent units. A different, more complex treatment of these groups is therefore required, which involves: a) initial retrieval of pre-stressed roots containing hiatuses from a table look-up b) stress assignment to other vowel sequences c) transcription according to stress position. Only primary stress is assigned by the following procedure, which searches in the string whether: a) the word ends either by a simple vowel (i.e. preceded Discussion and further developments Rules matched effectively the reference phonetic transcriptions in the SpeechDat corpus and showed to constitute a useful tool to generate new standard pronunciations, even when extended to new corpora, like the one adopted for the synthesis application. Further developments of the present system can consist in adding rules for pronunciation variants of standard Castilian Spanish, like South-American varieties (especially Mexican, Argentinian and Paraguayan), to be implemented within the recogniser as optional pronunciations to the standard forms, according to a procedure used to generate dialectal variants of standard Italian [ 19] . For synthesis, on the other hand, possible extensions would include restructuring rules at word boundary, which enable to automatically transcribe words within sentences. These rules should account for changes like place assimilation of final nasals and laterals to the following word-initial consonant (e.g. 'con ganas' [k o N g 'a n a s]; 'el cho\" fer' [e G1 T$ \"o f e r]); deletion of a final unstressed vowel before identical unstressed ones (e.g. 'la atmo'sfera' [l a Dh m \"o s f e r a]) and realisation of closed vowels as glides before a word-initial vowel (e.g. 'ni un' [nj'un]). Also syllabification rules can be added, in order to allow a more adequate treatment of vowel sequences.
