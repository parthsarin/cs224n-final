After conducting a preliminary exploratory study on Tamil discourse connectives, we show our observations and results of a pilot experiment that we conducted by annotating a small portion of our corpus. Our ultimate goal is to develop a Tamil Discourse Relation Bank that will be useful as a resource for further research in Tamil discourse. Furthermore, a study of the behavior of discourse connectives in Tamil will also help in furthering the cross-linguistic understanding of discourse connectives. Introduction The study of discourse structure in natural language processing has its applications in emerging fields such as coherence evaluation, question answering, natural language generation and textual summarization. Such a study is possible in a given human language only if there are sufficient discourse annotated resources available for that language. The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is a project whose goal is to annotate the discourse relations holding between events described in a text. The PDTB is a lexically grounded approach where discourse relations are anchored in lexical items wherever they are explicitly realized in the text (Miltsakaki et al. 2004 , Prasad et al., 2008) . To foster cross-linguistic studies in discourse relations, projects similar to the PDTB in discourse annotation were initiated in Czech (Mladov\u00e1 et al., 2008) , Chinese (Xue, 2005) , Turkish (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008) and Hindi (Prasad et al., 2008) . We explore how the underlying framework and annotation guidelines apply to Tamil, a morphologically rich, agglutinative, free word order language. In this paper, we present how a corpus of Tamil texts was created on which we performed our pilot experiment. Next, in Section 3 we cover the basics of the PDTB guidelines that we followed during our annotation process. In Section 4, we show various categories of Tamil discourse connectives that we identified after a preliminary study on discourse connectives in Tamil, illustrating each with examples. In Section 5, we discuss some interesting issues specific to Tamil that we encountered during discourse annotation and present the results of the pilot experiment that we performed on our source corpus. We conclude this paper in Section 6 by discussing about challenges that were unique to our work and our plans for the future. Source Corpus We collected Tamil encyclopedia articles from the June 2008 edition of the Wikipedia static HTML dumps 1 . Elements such as HTML metadata, navigational links, etc. were then removed until only the text of the articles remained. A corpus was then built by collecting the texts from all the articles in the dump. The corpus thus created consists of about 2.2 million words from approximately 200,000 sentences. Since the texts used in building the corpus were all encyclopedia articles featured in the Tamil language version of Wikipedia, the corpus covers a wide variety of topics including arts, culture, biographies, geography, society, history, etc., written and edited by volunteers from around the world. Penn Discourse Treebank Guidelines The PDTB is a resource built on discourse structure in (Webber and Joshi, 1998) where discourse connectives are treated as discourse-level predicates that always take exactly two abstract objects such as events, states and propositions as their arguments. We now describe the types of connectives and their senses from the PDTB framework and provide examples from Tamil sentences. Annotation Process The process of discourse annotation involves identifying discourse connectives in raw text and then annotating their arguments and semantics. Discourse connectives are identified as being explicit, implicit, AltLex, EntRel or NoRel (Prasad et al. 2008 ). These classes are described in detail in Section 4. By convention, annotated explicit connectives are underlined and implicit connectives are shown by the marker, \"(Implicit=)\". As can be seen in example (1), one of the arguments is shown enclosed between {} and the other argument is shown in []. The AltLex, EntRel or NoRel relations are shown by underlining, i.e., as \"(AltLex=)\", \"(EntRel)\" and \"(NoRel)\", respectively. Sense Hierarchy The semantics of discourse relations are termed as senses and are then classified hierarchically using four top-level classes \"Comparison\", \"Contingency\", \"Expansion\" and \"Temporal\". Each class is refined by its component types and these, in turn, are further refined by the subtype level. It is interesting to note that some connectives have multiple senses. In example (2) the affixedum connective carries the sense of type Expan-sion:Conjunction \"also\" whereas in example (3) the same affix carries the sense of the subtype Contingency:Concession \"however\". ( Discourse Connectives in Tamil Tamil is an agglutinative language where morphemes are affixed to the roots of individual words, a trait that it shares with many other Dravidian languages and languages like Turkish, Estonian and Japanese. Here, each affix represents information such as discourse connective, gender, number, etc. We now describe how we try to capture various types of Tamil discourse connectives using a proposed scheme which is based on the existing PDTB guidelines proposed by (Prasad et al., 2007) . Explicit Discourse Connectives Explicit discourse connectives are lexical items present in text that are used to anchor the discourse relations portrayed by them. In Tamil, they are found as affixes to the verb, as in example (4) where the affix -Al conveys the meaning \"so\". This is in a way similar to the simplex subordinators in Turkish, as described in (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008) . However, like in English, explicit discourse connectives are also realized as unbound lexical items, as can be seen in example (5) where the word eNavE means \"hence\". Syntactically, explicit connectives can be coordinating conjunctions e.g., alladu (\"or\"), subordinating conjunctions e.g., -Al (\"so\"), sentential relatives e.g., -adaNAl (\"because of which\"), particles e.g.,um (\"also\") or adverbials e.g., -pOdu (\"just then\"). Explicit connectives also occur as conjoined connectives where two or more instances of connectives share the same two arguments. Such connectives are annotated as distinct types and are annotated discontinuously, as seen in example ( 6 ) where the connectives -um and -um are paired together to share the same arguments. Implicit Discourse Connectives Implicit discourse connectives are inserted between adjacent sentence pairs that are not related explicitly by any of the syntactically defined set of explicit connectives. In such a case, we attempted to infer a discourse relation between the sentences and a connective expression that best conveys the inferred relation is inserted. In example (7), the implicit expression uthAraNamAga (\"for example\") has been inserted as an inferred discourse relation between the two sentences. AltLex, EntRel and NoRel In cases where no implicit connective was appropriately found to be placed between adjacent sentence-pairs, we now look at three distinct classes. AltLex relations, as seen in example ( 8 ) are discourse relations where the insertion of an implicit connective leads to a redundancy in its expression as the relation is already alternatively lexicalized by some other expression that cannot be labeled as an explicit connective. Example ( 9 ) shows an En-tRel relation where no discourse relation can be inferred and the second sentence provides further description of an entity realized in the first sentence. When neither a discourse relation nor entitybased coherence can be inferred between the two adjacent sentences, it is described as a NoRel, shown in example ( 10 ). Observations and Results Combined connectives There is a paired connective -um \u2026 -um (\u2026) that sometimes expresses an Expansion:Conjunction relation between the events where each -um is suffixed to the verb that describes each event (see example ( 6 )). Also, there is a connective -Al which usually never occurs more than once and sometimes expresses a Contingency:Cause relation between two events. It is interesting to see that in sentences like (11), the -Al combines with the -um \u2026 -um to express something like a new type of relation. In the process, the -um \u2026 -um causes the -Al, which is usually not doubled, to become doubled, thereby forming an -Alum \u2026 -Alum. We call this special type of connectives as combined connectives, as shown in example ( 11 ). Results of Pilot Study In this experiment, we looked at 511 sentences from the corpus mentioned in Section 2 and annotated a total of 323 connectives. While a higher percentage of the connectives annotated are those of the Explicit type, it can also be seen that there is a higher proportion of unique connectives in the Implicit and AltLex types. Note that since EntRel and NoRel connectives are not associated with a sense relation or a lexical item, their counts are left blank. Challenges and Future Work The agglutinative nature of the Tamil language required a deeper analysis to look into suffixes that act as discourse connectives in addition to those that occur as unbounded lexical items. We also found certain interesting examples that were distinct from those observed during similar approaches in relatively less morphologically rich languages like English. While this was a first attempt at creating a discourse annotated Tamil corpus, we are planning to conduct future work involving multiple annotators which would yield information on annotation metrics like inter-annotator agreement, for example. Our work and results would also be useful for similar approaches in other morphologically rich and related South Indian languages such as Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, etc. We will also work on a way in which the discourse annotations have been performed will help in augmenting the information provided during dependency annotations at the sentence-level.
