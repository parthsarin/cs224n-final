The tool allows the manual annotation of certain linguistic items in the source text and their translation equivalent in the target text, by entering useful information about these items based on their context. Introduction The annotation tool, Coreference Annotator, has been developed within the framework of wider research in the analysis of parallel texts from a translation point of view. More specifically, the research attempts a theoretical classification of the translation of European Union texts in the light of Relevance Theory (Tsoumari, 2008) , and examines a special use monodirectional bilingual corpus consisting of aligned English (originals/source texts) and Greek (translations/target texts) versions of press releases of the European Commission. The aim of the annotation tool is for the researcher to trace and annotate manually certain linguistic items in the source text and their translation equivalent in the target text, by entering useful information about these items based on their context. The focus for this study is on identifying discourse markers and conjunctions that express concession/contrast/adversity in the source text and then locating their translation equivalent in the target text. To the group of markers mentioned above, the conjunction 'and' has been added. Cases of omission of source text conjunctions or discourse markers, or addition of conjunctions or discourse markers in the target text are also marked. Motivation The scope of the research that motivated the creation of this tool combines mainly translation, parallel corpora (original-source texts and translationtarget texts), semantics, pragmatics, and discourse. A parallel aligned corpus of press releases of the European Commission is examined both translationally and linguistically to reach conclusions about how certain linguistic items are translated, potentially reflecting the intention of the authors; the expectations of the readers; whether intentionality and expectations change when moving from the source text to the target text; and effects from genre, discourses depending on the topics of the documents, public sentiment or culture. Translation in the EU There is an intriguing matter in the translation of European Union documents into all or some of the official languages of the European Union. On the one hand, there are rules and regulations governing the operation of European countries together as a whole, as a single unity forming the European Union, and EU culture and mentality. On the other hand, the European countries-member states maintain their national cultures and mentalities. Research has shown that the culture of the EU edifice is different from national cultures, has a culture of its own, despite the likely blurred borderlines between them (Koskinen, 2001; Koskinen, 2004) . EU texts and their translation serve a primary communicative situation, since original texts are written to be translated so as to help EU (source text) authors reach different national (target) language users. Some of the characteristics of EU texts are that they are often produced and translated almost at the same time (Koutsivitis, 1994) ; translation may constitute the starting point to improve the 'original' (Koutsivitis, 2003) ; the writers are usually a group of people or a committee; most source texts are written in English and to a lesser degree in French and German (three procedural languages); the authors are not necessarily native speakers of the language they use for writing; source texts may not always be written in one language and have special linguistic, syntactical and stylistic characteristics called Eurojargon, Eurobabble or Eurospeak (Trosborg, 1997) . Thus the translation process, strategies and methods are also affected by the particular circumstances of the production of target texts. Press releases of the European Commission EU press releases are one of the types of documents produced in the framework of the European Union and are distinct from non-EU press releases. The reason is that if we accept that the European Union has a culture of its own, as Koskinen (2001; Koskinen (2004) argues, then it is only normal to expect the production of EU culturespecific texts and genres. EC (European Commission) press releases are produced under the same EU-specific conditions as most EU documents are, i.e. multiple versions drafted and translated at the same time, non-native speakers drafting the documents etc. Culture has its own manner to construct and partition reality which is mirrored in its discourses, that is \"modes of talking and thinking which can become ritualised\" (Hatim and Mason, 1990) . EU culture is no exception to that. In a corpus of aligned EC press releases an issue worth examining is whether the translation is affected by the different topics and discourses of the press releases. Connectives: Relevance theory and Sentiment analysis Connectives have been selected to be examined because they draw attention due to their status. According to Relevance Theory (Wilson and Sperber, 2002) , the author produces his/her speech in such a way so that the reader will reach the speaker-intended interpretation with the least processing effort. The speaker, in order to achieve this, makes certain assumptions about the reader's background knowledge and, thus, expectations, and based on these assumptions formulates his/her discourse. From a relevance-theoretic perspective (Wilson and Sperber, 1993; Blakemore, 1987) , connectives are not linking items, but devices whose meaning plays a part in the interpretation of an utterance. Among the different interpretations available, the hearer will decide which the speaker-intended one is, and connectives can facilitate the elimination of some of the available interpretations in order to achieve optimal relevance (Rouchota, 1998), i.e. the best possible interpretation for the hearer in terms of processing effort and effect. Connectives have also been discussed in sentiment analysis. There is research which uses linguistic analysis and techniques to explore the sentiment of each sentence or phrase in a document. Meena and Prabhakar (2007) addressed the effects of conjunctions and sentence constructions in extracting sentiments associated with the phrases or sentences of reviews. Conjunctions are seen as crucial constituents when determining the polarity of a sentence. They found that, usually, either they alter the sentiment orientation to the opposite direction or they enhance the sentiment of the sentence. Agarwal et al. (2008) involved in automatic sentiment analysis at sentence level in movie, car and book reviews observed that sentence structure has a fair contribution towards sentiment determination; conjunctions play a major role in defining the sentence structure. Their basic assumption is: \"Not all phrases joined by a conjunct have same level of significance in overall sentiment determination\". Related tools Parallel corpora are often used as linguistic resources in translation. Special tools have been designed to facilitate research in translation and mul-tilingual parallel texts. Callisto is a multilingual, multiplatform tool providing a set of \"annotation services\" (Day et al., 2004) . Its standard components are textual annotation view and a configurable table display. Some of the tasks performed are automatic content extraction entity and relation detection, characterization and co-reference, temporal phrase normalization, named entity tagging, event and temporal expression tagging etc. The IAMTC Project combines already existing facilities and newly developed ones and has developed an annotation tool for text manipulation. The Project involves the creation of multilingual parallel corpora with semantic annotation to be used in natural language applications (Farwell et al., 2008) . Annotation includes dependency parsing, associating semantic concepts with lexical units, and assigning theta roles. MULTEXT (Ide and V\u00e9ronis, 1994 ) is a project involving the development of tools on the basis of \"software reusability\", and multilingual parallel corpora. It combines NLP and speech, and examines the possibilities for such a combination by harmonizing tools and methods from both areas. The annotation is performed with a segmenter, a morphological analyser, a part of speech disambiguator, an aligner, a prosody tagger, and postediting tools. Thus, the annotated data provide information about syntax, morphology, prosody and the alignment of parallel texts. Propbank is a project where a corpus is annotated with semantic roles for verb predicates (Choi et al., 2010) . Annotation is performed with the help of Jubilee by simultaneously presenting syntactic and semantic information. The process is facilitated by Cornerstone, a user-friendly xml editor, customized to allow frame authors to create and edit frameset files. Finally, there is ParaConc (Barlow, 2002) whose main characteristics are an alignment function, concordance search, search for specific words and their possible translations, corpus frequency and collocate frequency. But the tool has no annotating function. These tools cannot fully meet the particularities of this research for the reasons discussed next. Need for a new tool The underlying factor that can bring the above different aspects and approaches together is an an-notation tool that features certain specific characteristics that are hard to find all in one annotation tool. Coreference Annotator has those characteristics. In particular, a) uploading aligned texts already processed in an efficient alignment tool so as to achieve maximum alignment performance. The tool's ability to have as input aligned documents allows a corpus builder to use a reliable external aligner of one's own choice and then use the annotation scheme for the manual annotation of the aligned corpus; b) depicting the aligned texts in such an arrangement that each pair of aligned texts is clearly separated from the other pairs of aligned texts; each translation unit consisting of the source text segment and the target text segment in each pair of aligned texts is clearly and easily detectable from the other translation units. At the same time, it keeps its place in the text manifesting coherence and flow of text meaning in each language; c) allowing the location of possible translation equivalents in context of the instances of the linguistic items examined, always keeping the source text item and its target text equivalent in a close, binary relationship. This unfolds the variety of equivalents an item can have that may be either context dependent or context independent, and also highlights translation procedures and strategies; d) allowing the creation of a comparable profile at sentence level of the source text entry and the target text equivalent entry by entering accompanying information based on their context (distribution of the entries, collocations etc.) in the appropriate sections and fields of attributes -the source text entry and its equivalent text entry are seen comprehensively as a whole; e) displaying all the attribute sections and fields for each source text entry and its target text equivalent with one click to provide easy access which is important due to the large amount of data; f) allowing the examination of the target text in its own right to identify the cases, if any, of linguistic items under investigation that are present in the target text without being a translation equivalent of a source text entry; the annotation tool also provides for the creation of a profile for each target text addition entry; g) allowing the correlation of discourse topics with the frequency of the linguistic items and their translation equivalents in the two languages, and also with their microenvironments, thanks to the arrangement of the aligned texts; h) allowing the correlation of discourse topics, the frequency of the linguistic items and their translation equivalents, and the frequency of the items added in the target text; i) providing statistics based on the relationship of the source text entry and its target text equivalent where each result is fully and directly traceable in the corpus not only in terms of which pair of aligned texts it is found in but also in terms of its exact location in the pair, thus keeping track of text meaning and structure, and discourse; j) providing detailed statistics which allows the grouping of information of the profile of the entries for specialized analysis of results; k) producing tables of statistics exportable to widely commercial formats e.g. excel for further processing, e.g. SPSS. Such a sophisticated annotation tool allows multidisciplinary analysis. Finally, the tool has been implemented as a component of the Ellogon language engineering platform (Petasis et al., 2002) , making extensive use of its infrastructure for the easy creation of annotation tools. Corpus of Collections This tool has been tested with a corpus of English-Greek press releases issued by the European Commission from 1/1/2007 to 1/1/2009. The corpus was drawn from the electronic text library of all EU press releases (RAPID) 1 . The criteria for text selection of that corpus are the availability of a Greek version and the currency of topics. The corpus consists of three thematic collections: the Environment, Agriculture, and Presidency Conclusions, which are further subdivided into thematic subcollections within each collection to make transparent the different discourses. The corpus has been aligned using the WinAlign alignment tool -an application of the SDL Trados 2007 suite. Exporting the aligned corpus in plain text format made it an appropriate input for the annotation tool which has been adapted to accommodate such input. The use of a long-standing professional alignment tool aims at achieving effective performance in the segmentation of the parallel texts at the level of equivalent sentences or text segments, i.e. translation units (SDL, 2007) . Annotation scheme Annotation is conducted by associating attributes to the linguistic items. The annotation tool contains three sections of attribute fields. The first section is general and the most frequently used. 1 http://europa.eu/rapid/searchAction.do In the first section, the focus is on the source text entry (ST EN) and the target text entry (TT EL) where the latter is considered the translation equivalent of the former in that context. The ST EN fields that follow relate to accompanying information of that token based on the particular context. The same goes for the TT EL fields. The next section, TT Addition, involves the addition of the items in question in the target texts. The third section, Context, involves the context of the texts. The original concept of that section is an attempt to map the differences emerging from the translation process between the two texts. There is great flexibility in designing the annotation scheme since using xml language allows the creation of different attributes and values or sections of attributes or the change of the existing attributes and values or sections of attributes. Toolbar The toolbar is on the top of the screen (see Figure 1 ) where the collections and the filenames of the aligned documents of each collection are found. The arrow icons guide the annotator to the next or previous document of the collection. Few more icons facilitate managing the documents. After selecting a collection and an aligned document, on the left side of the tool we can see the document in an aligned form -one column with the source text (ST) and one column with the target text (TT). The aligned document is presented in translation units, i.e. linked source and target text segments, with serial numbers for each unit for easier reference/retrieval when analysing a corpus. Also, to facilitate the visual separation of the translation units the background colour of the units alternates between white and light blue. First section of attributes -General On the right side of the tool, the three sections of attributes are presented. In the first section, the focus is on the source text entry (ST EN) and the target text entry (TT EL) where the latter is considered the translation equivalent of the former in that context. The ST EN and TT EL fields that follow relate to accompanying information of those tokens based on the particular context. When there is an arrow icon on the fields, there is a drop-down list of attributes to select. When an item is annotated the tool highlights it. Different annotated entries are highlighted with different colours but each ST EN entry has the same colour with its TT EL equivalent entry. The fields ST EN/TT EL Expression accommodate cases where the ST EN/TT EL entries are part of an expression or form a collocation with the surrounding words. Each entry is also annotated for its rhetorical relation and category in that particular context. The values in these fields have been selected in relation to the connectives and discourse markers of interest. For cases where the discourse marker or connective has another function besides the linking one, the value \"0\" in the ST/TT Rhetorical Relation fields and the value \"Other\" in the ST/TT Category fields have been provided. There is also provision if a punctuation mark is in place of a TT EL entry. The checkbox of the ST/TT Phrase-level connection provides information about how often the ST and TT markers/connectives in question link predicates or non-predicates (noun phrases, adjectival phrases etc.) in their language respectively. Difference in the type of connection between the ST EN entry and its TT EL equivalent entry manifests different syntactic structures, and perhaps participant roles in the source and target languages. This in turn may reflect translation strategies e.g. shifts, transpositions, modulations etc. The ST/TT Position fields relate to the distribution of the tokens. When the ST EN entry and its TT EL equivalent are seen in parallel and a change in position is noted, then different thematic and rhematic structures, and focus may be reflected in the two languages. Omission of an ST EN entry in the target text is also checked. The last two fields, \"ST Comment\" and \"TT Comment\", allow comments by the annotator of the corpus that can be used either in revising or in analysing the corpus annotation. An example can be a token of the additive conjunction 'and' (see Figure 1 ): This entry involves the token 'and', highlighted with blue colour in the translation unit 20. Based on its attributes, it is a conjunction of addition (ST Rhetorical Relation = \"Addition\"), a coordinator in particular (ST Category = \"Coordinator\"), and connects phrases (non-predicates) (\"ST Phrase-level Connection\" box checked). The token acting as its equivalent in the target text is \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 (kae) 'and', which is also a conjunction of addition (TT Rhetorical Relation = \"Addition\"), a coordinator (TT Category = \"Coordinator\"), and connects non-predicates (\"TT Phrase-level Connection\" box checked). Second section of attributes -TT Addition The next section, TT Addition, involves the addition of the items in question in the target texts (see Figure 2 -TT Addition). There are similar fields as in the first section of attributes. Because in this section of attributes the starting point is the target text, a couple of extra fields of attributes have been added: the \"TT Rendering of\" field which attempts to classify the category of the word/phrase in the ST, if any, that motivated the addition of the discourse marker/connective in the TT; the \"TT Analysis/Rendering of Text/Expression\" field where the ST word/phrase is entered. Finally, there is one more field, ST Clue for Additional TT EL. Practically, this and the previous field have a similar function. An example can be found in translation unit 5 (see Figure 2 ): According to the annotation, the TT EL entry \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 (kae) 'and' was added in translation unit 5, is not used as a conjunction (TT Rhetorical Relation=0) and performs a different function from coordination in the structure of the sentence (TT Category=Other). Third section -Context The third section involves the context of the texts (see Figure 3 ). The original concept of that section is an attempt to map the differences that emerge from the translation process. These differences can be grammatical e.g. a change in the tense of a verb form, semantic e.g. the choice of a slightly/a lot different semantically TT EL equivalent, pragmatic e.g. the choice of a completely different ex-pression in the TT to render ST meaning, or lexical e.g. the addition or omission of a word/phrase in one of the two texts. The following pairs of fields have been designed: ST Verb (or verb phrase) -TT Verb (or verb phrase), ST Adjective (or adjectival phrase) -TT Adjective (or adjectival phrase), ST Adverb (or adverbial phrase) -TT Adverb (or adverbial phrase), ST Other -TT Other. The last pair involves differences that do not fall under any of the other pairs. Then the differences recorded can be evaluated compared with each other based on which of the two options -ST option or TT option -is more or less strong in meaning, more or less informative, more or less appellative, and more or less affective. Some of these differences between the two texts are mandatory driven by language restrictions, for instance, or optional driven by cultural preferences, register, politics etc. Either way, these differences create an effect to the reader. So under the ST fields there are two checkboxes ST More, ST Less and under the TT fields respectively TT More, TT Less. For each difference entered the relevant box is checked; ST entry evaluated as ST More or ST Less and TT equivalent evaluated as TT More or TT Less. There is one last checkbox in this section, Compensation, called after the translation strategy. Compensation refers to making up for the loss of meaning or effect in some part of the sentence in another part of that sentence or in a contiguous sentence (Newmark, 1988) . This box is checked when the difference in context in the two texts is due to the translation strategy of compensation. An example can be in translation unit 7 (see Figure 4 ): According to the annotation, the ST phrase 'This aims to' in translation unit 7, entered in the ST Other field is classified as ST Less compared to its TT equivalent phrase \u039c\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c1\u03cd\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 (Mae ti metarythmisi epidioketai) 'With the reform it is aimed'. The reason is the act of referring in the English segment where the demonstrative pronoun 'This', a lexicalized deictic element or indexical, is clarified in the Greek segment with the nominal referent \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c1\u03cd\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 (metarythmisi) 'reform'. So the TT phrase is more informative than the ST phrase. Because the foregrounded nominal in the TT phrase \u039c\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c1\u03cd\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 (Mae ti metarythmisi epidioketai) 'With the reform it is aimed' refers to the pronominal fronted in the ST, this is another factor which enhances the effect of the referring act in relation to the transposition between active and passive voice. Thus, the referring act prevails and classifies the TT phrase as TT More. Statistics Detailed statistics tables are produced covering all possible search criteria. The findings are easily traceable in the corpus in terms of collection, aligned text and position of the translation unit where the item is found in the aligned text. In particular, three tables are generated. The first table (see Figure 4 ) presents all the source text tokens of interest per aligned document and collection, their frequency, their translation equivalents along with their own frequency, and cases of omission of the source text connectives/discourse markers in the target text. At the end of each collection, there is the subtotal of the frequency of source text connectives/discourse markers and their translation equivalents. After all the collections have been examined the table presents the total results of the total of collections. An important element is that next to each result there are the numbered translation units where the source text connective/discourse marker and its target text equivalent are found. This last feature allows easy retrieval of the translation unit, which ensures keeping track of text meaning and structure, and flow of discourse. The second table (see Figure 5 ) presents grouped data based on the first section of at-  tributes. It includes the elements of the first statistics table enriched with the accompanying attributes of both source and target text entries. The results present linearly, focusing on the ST entry -TT equivalent entry pair, the attributes which accompany the pair. Every time an attribute of the pair changes, there is a different entry in the results. Again, information on the document, collection and translation unit where the pairs with the specific attributes are found satisfies any search criteria. The third statistics table involves results from the second section of attributes -TT Addition. It follows the rationale of statistics table 2 (Figure 5 ) but it focuses only on the target text items that have been added without being a translation equivalent of the source text items in question. Statistics for the third section of attributes about Context has not been designed yet because this section of attributes has not been fully tested in the corpus. Conclusion The Coreference Annotator is an annotation tool which is user friendly in its operation. It gives the researcher the advantage of selecting an external alignment tool for aligning a corpus of parallel texts according to his/her needs. It allows great flexibility in the study of various linguistic items and the translation process at the same time providing, therefore, multiple levels of analysis. Thus the researcher works with a tool that is easily adjustable to his/her varied needs in relation with the annotation of bilingual data.",
