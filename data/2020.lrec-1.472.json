In this paper, we present an enhanced Sejong POS mapping to the UPOS in accordance with the Korean linguistic typology and the substantive definitions of the UPOS categories. This work updated one third of the Sejong POS mapping to the UPOS. We also introduced a new mapping for the KAIST POS tag set, another widely used Korean POS tag set, to the UPOS. Introduction The Universal Part-Of-Speech tag set (UPOS) (Petrov et  al., 2012) has been widely used as a standard for mapping various POS tag sets across multiple languages to facilitate building and evaluating multi-lingual taggers and parsers (McDonald et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2014;  Park, 2017). In 2014, the extended UPOS (UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014) was released as part of the Universal Dependencies (UD) project, which aims to develop crosslanguage treebank annotation. The recent UD version 2.5 has released 157 treebanks in 90 languages in Nov 2019 1 . When mapping a language specific POS tag set to the UPOS, it is important to map it correctly based on: (1) the definitions of the UPOS categories; and (2) the individual language's linguistic topology. It should not be just matching to the equivalent categories' name 2 . When the original UPOS (UPOS12) was proposed by Petrov, each category was defined operationally (Petrov et al., 2012). However, there were some ambiguities to the interpretation of these categories. This problem was addressed in the extended UPOS (UPOS14) in 2014 (UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014) 3 . Clear definitions and explanatory examples were provided for the 17 categories of the UPOS including five new categories 4 , which were identified as essential categories to many languages. Following the detailed guidelines, one can build an appropriate mapping scheme and justify their mapping results. The first morpheme-based mapping for Korean POS tag set to the UPOS12 was introduced by Park and colleagues  (2016). They proposed a mapping for the Sejong POS tag set, one of the most widely used Korean POS tag set. 1 https://universaldependencies.org/ 2 Note that words called as numerals in some languages (e.g. Czech) should be tagged with the UPOS ADJ (adjective) as recommended by UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014. 3 UD annotation guidelines v2 was released in 2016 (UD annotation guidelines v2). The UPOS from v1 was kept the same in v2 except for two minor revisions (https://universaldependencies.org/v2/summary.html); it includes updates on definitions of AUX and PART tags. 4 PROPN (proper noun), AUX (auxiliary), SCONJ (subordinate conjunction), SW (symbol) and INTJ (interjection) Recently, Park and Tyers (2019) updated this mapping to the UPOS14. In this work, they also discussed how the mapping can be applied to build a training corpus for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Semantic Role Labelling (SRL) tasks. While providing an updated mapping, Park and Tyers  (2019) did not make substantial changes to the initial UPOS mapping (Park et al., 2016) 5 . More importantly, the updated mapping was not discussed nor justified. In this paper, we review the Sejong POS mapping to the UPOS14 proposed by Park and Tyers (2019), and suggest and discuss linguistically motivated changes. We also present two new mapping schemes for Korean POS tag sets (Sejong POS and KAIST POS) to the UPOS14. Finally, we discuss the potential impact of the new Sejong POS mapping to the UPOS on Korean NER task a through qualitative analysis. Korean Segmentation English is defined as a fusional language where a single inflection 6 can convey multiple grammar roles. For example, the English sentence \"John draws a picture.\" consists of four words ('John', 'draws', 'a' and 'picture')  and five morphemes ('John', 'draw', 's', 'a' and  'picture'); the one bound morpheme -s carries three grammatical roles including person (third person), number (singular) and tense (present). English has one inflectional morpheme per word and is a weakly inflected language with only eight inflectional morphemes 7 (Brinton, 2000;  Yule, 2010). As a result, English text is usually segmented at the word level without compromising further downstream processing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Korean, on the other hand, is defined as an agglutinative language where each inflection conveys only a single grammatical role (Eifring and Theil, 2004). For example, 5 Only two mappings were updated to the newly introduced UPOS14 categories: PROPN and INTJ. 6 The modification of a word to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender and mood. 7 Eight inflectional morphemes: two for nouns (-s for plural and 's for possessive), two for adjectives (-er for comparative and -est for superlative) and four for verbs (s for 3rd singular present tense, -ed for past tense, -ed for past participle and -ing for present participle). as shown in Table 1 , the sentence \"\ub098\ub294 \uce5c\uad6c\ub4e4\uc744 \ub9cc\ub0ac\ub2e4.\" consists of three words and eight morphemes. Moreover, Korean is a highly inflected language with many inflectional morphemes including about 150 postpositions and about 500 verb endings (Kang, 2006). Unlike English, Korean usually has multiple morphemes per word. Words Morphemes with POS \ub098\ub294 \"I\" In Korean, words split by a space are called eojeols, which are formed by joining a content morpheme (e.g., a noun or a verb stem) and functional morphemes (e.g., postpositions, suffixes and endings). Therefore, to process text and segment sentences into linguistic units some have relied on space segmentation and others have relied on morphological analysis. We discuss the pros and cons of both approaches. Eojeol Segmentation Initially, Petrov and colleagues (2012) Morpheme Segmentation Many Korean NLP applications are based on morpheme segmentation including phrase-structure parsing (Choi et  al., 2012; Park et al., 2016) and statistical machine translation (Park et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017). For Korean word embedding models, morpheme segmentation is usually used to avoid expensive computational cost caused by the exponential increase in new vocabularies with eojeol segmentation (Lee, 2019). It is more efficient to segment words into morphemes to cover all the possible inflected verb forms. Compared to eojeol segmentation, morpheme segmentation involves a lot more work as it requires a morphological analysis. But it presents a number of advantages, like the ability to conduct fine-grained segmentation to facilitate a numbers of NLP tasks. Fortuitously, there are a handful of open-source Korean morphological analysers available. For example, KoNLPy, a python-based wrapper, provides an easy access to five widely used Korean taggers including KKMA, KOMORAN, MECAB-KO, HANNANUM and OKT. It is essential to segment Korean text into morphemes to understand the function of each morpheme, especially for the Part-of-Speech (POS) task in NLP. Morpheme segmentation also alleviates the issues of data sparsity and postposition analysis. Therefore, we chose this segmentation approach for the POS mapping proposed. Mapping Sejong POS to UPOS To develop a mapping scheme for the Sejong POS tag set to the UPOS14, we started by reviewing the most recent mapping by Park and Tyers (2019) with the up-to-date UPOS definitions (UD annotation guidelines v2, 2016). Out of 45 Sejong POS tags, we revised 12 Sejong POS tag mapping while agreeing on the remaining 33. As Park and Tyers (2019) did not discuss or provide explanations about their mapping, it was hard to compare the two mapping schemes. In the following subsections, we present and discuss the proposed changes. We also present relevant examples derived from the Google Korean UD Treebank (GKT) corpus 11 for the proposed mapping on the 12 Sejong POS tags. Herewith UPOS denotes the UPOS14 for simplicity. Sejong SL and SH tags The Sejong SL tag denotes words written in foreign languages and the Sejong SH tag denotes words written in Chinese characters. In the initial Sejong POS mapping to the UPOS12 (Park et  al., 2016), the SL and SH tags were mapped to the UPOS X tag, which was defined as 'a catch-all for other categories such as abbreviations or foreign words (Petrov  et al., 2012)'. Then, when the UPOS14 was proposed, the definition of the X tag changed completely and was restricted to 'words that are not possible to analyse' 12 (UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014). Despite the changed definition of the X tag, in Park and Tyers' work (2019), the SL and SH tags were still mapped to the X tag. Therefore, we proposed a new mapping for these two tags based on their actual usage and the new X tag definition. We analysed the SL and SH tagged words found in the Google UD Korean Treebank (GKT) corpus. We manually examined all the instances of the SL and SH tagged words from a subset of the GKT corpus (development corpus), which consists of 950 sentences. We found 185 SL tags across 99 sentences; among them 136 were assigned to words used as proper nouns (e.g. 'KIA', 'SK' and 'LG\uc804\uc790'), 29 were assigned to words used as general nouns (e.g., 'TV' and 'CEO'), and 20 were incorrectly 13 assigned to words expressing units (e.g. 'km' and 'kg'). We also found 27 SH tags across 17 sentences; among them 22 SH tags were assigned to words used as proper nouns (e.g. '\u674e\u5c0f\u9f8d' -'Bruce Lee') and 5 SH tags were assigned to words used as general nouns (e.g.'\uc5ed\uc0ac(\u529b\u58eb)' -'a man of great strength'). As both tags were mainly used as proper nouns (73% of SL tag and 78% of SH tag) and in some cases as general nouns (27% of SL tag and 22% of SH tag), we propose to map them to the UPOS PROPN tag as shown in Table 2 . 11 The GKT corpus consists of three parts for development, training and testing. It contains a total of 6339 sentences, 80,322 eojeols and 151,737 morphemes. 12 'those ordinary loan words should be assigned a normal POS tag and X tag should be used very restrictively for' (UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014) 13 In the GKT corpus, units are tagged inconsistently with the Sejong SW (symbol) and SL tags even within a sentence. Thus, we considered them as incorrectly tagged words. Sejong POS UPOS14 Previous New SL (Foreign characters) X PROPN SH (Chinese characters) X PROPN Table 2 : Proposed mapping for the SL and SH tags While somewhat imperfect, this new mapping allows us to preserve some information. We will discuss the impact of this new mapping on the Korean NER task in the Discussion section. Sejong JC and EC tags In Park and Tyers' work (2019), all the Sejong POS tags for postpositions including the JC tag (conjunctive particle) were mapped to the UPOS ADP tag (adposition). This tag represents prepositions and postpositions and is defined as 'a complement composed of a noun phrase, noun, pronoun or clause that functions as a noun phrase to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause' (UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014). However, as discussed by Ahn and Song (2011), in Korean, coordinate conjunction for noun is expressed by conjunctive particles. For example, in (1) '\uba54\ub9ac+\uc640 \ud0d0' (1) (Mary and Tom) the conjunctive particle '-\uc640' is used to link the two proper nouns 'Mary' and 'Tom. Following Ahn and Song's analysis, we propose to remap the JC tag to the UPOS CCONJ tag as shown in Table 3 . The Sejong EC tag represents all three types of conjunctive endings: equal conjunctive ending, subordinate conjunctive ending and auxiliary conjunctive ending. Each of them has a corresponding UPOS tag: equal conjunctive ending could be mapped to the CCONJ tag (coordinate conjunction), subordinate conjunctive ending to the SCONJ tag (subordinate conjunction) and auxiliary conjunctive ending to the PART tag (particle). Since we have only one Sejong tag (EC) to represent them all, we need to choose the most appropriate one. (3) (because Mary is sick\u2026) the subordinate conjunctive ending '-\uc11c (because)' is used to form a subordinate clause. Both the CCONJ and SCONJ tags seem to be valid mapping for the EC tag. Choosing one over another will result in losing some information. Therefore, we included each mapping in our summary table (Table 8 ). The choice should be made based on the corpus and the downstream NLP task. It is worth noting that the KKMA Korean POS tagger outputs 56 POS tags based on the 46 Sejong POS tags 14 . The additional POS tags include the conjunctive endings: ECE (equal conjunctive ending), ECD (subordinate conjunctive ending) and ECS (auxiliary conjunctive ending) allowing a 1-to-1 mapping to the UPOS CCONJ, SCONJ and PART tags. Sejong Sejong NNB and NR tags The NNB tag represents both unit bound nouns 15 and bound nouns. Unit bound nouns express the unit of quantity and bound nouns are special function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning. Thus, the NNB tag denotes dependent nouns. In the initial Sejong POS mapping to the UPOS12 (Park et  al., 2016), all noun related Sejong POS tags, including the NNB tag, were mapped to the UPOS NOUN tag. In the UPOS14, the definition of the NOUN tag was clarified from simply noted as 'Nouns' in the UPOS12 to 'Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea. The NOUN tag is intended for common nouns only' (UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014). However, despite this change, the Sejong NNB was still mapped to the UPOS NOUN tag in the recently updated mapping proposed by Park and Tyers (2019). We, therefore, propose to remap the Sejong NNB tag to the UPOS ADP tag in line with ADP's definition 'a complement composed of a noun phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and that form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within 14 The mappings between the Sejong POS tag set and the KKMA POS tag set http://kkma.snu.ac.kr/documents/?doc=postag 15 There is no English equivalent to the unit bound noun (NNB) while it is well developed in Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Thai (Ahn and Song, 2011). a clause' (UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014, we underlined the text in this quote). Similarly, the Sejong NR tag (numeral) represents numbers for quantity and sequence written in the Korean alphabet (Hangeul). In the UPOS14, the definition of the NUM tag was updated to 'cardinal numbers are covered by NUM whether they are expressed as words (four), digits (4) or Roman numerals (IV)' (UD annotation guidelines v1, 2014). Despite the evident mapping between the NR tag and the UPOS NUM tag, Park and colleagues (2016) and Park & Tyers (2019) mapped the NR tag to the UPOS NOUN tag. We believe it is an oversight and changes should be made to map correctly the NR tag to the UPOS NUM tag. This would allow identifying the numeral value correctly as illustrated by the example below. As shown in  The Sejong EP tag represents prefinal ending, which precedes verb ending to express tense or honorification. This tag was previously mapped to the UPOS PART tag, which should be used restrictively only when no other tag is suitable according to its definition (described in the section 3.2). We propose to remap the Sejong EP tag to the UPOS AUX tag as it better satisfy the definitions of the UPOS AUX and PART tags. Sejong MAJ and SW tags The Sejong MAJ tag represents conjunctive adverbs that join two complete sentences. Conjunctive adverbs are generally located in front of a sentence, which it is modifying. For example, see ( '\uc9c0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3c8\ub2e4.' (The Earth spins.) (4) '\uadf8\ub7ec\ub098/MAJ, \uc544\ubb34\ub3c4 \uadf8\uac83\uc744 \ubbff\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.' (However, nobody believed it.) As mentioned earlier, in Korean, coordinate and subordinate conjunctions are expressed by postpositions and verb endings within a sentence. Korean conjunctive adverbs such as \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 (additionally), \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 (however), \uadf8\ub798\uc11c (therefore) go over the boundary of a sentence; and therefore should be seen as adverbs like in English (Ahn and Song, 2011). As shown in Table 7 , we propose to remap the MAJ tag to the UPOS ADV tag. The Sejong SW tag denotes symbols such as maths symbols and currency symbols. In the initial mapping scheme by Park and colleagues (2016), the SW tag was mapped to the UPOS X tag as there was no UPOS tag available for symbols in the UPOS12. The UPOS SYM tag was introduced in the UPOS14 to cover symbols. However, when Park and Tyers revised the Sejong POS mapping to the UPOS (2019), they did not make use of this new tag and kept the initial mapping to the UPOS X tag. Therefore, we propose to remap the Sejong SW tag to the UPOS SYM tag as shown in Table 7 . This revision allows symbols to be tagged correctly rather than to be treated as unanalysable characters. Sejong POS UPOS14 Previous New MAJ (Conjunctive adverb) CCONJ ADV SW (Symbols) X SYM Mapping Results Table 8 summarises all the changes we propose (highlighted in bold font). These changes affected about one third of the existing mappings. We believe that this revision takes full advantages of the up-to-date UPOS definitions, the newly introduced UPOS tags and also takes into account linguistic usage. As discussed earlier, the EC tag has been assigned to both the CCONJ and SCONJ tags. Our updated mapping now includes the UPOS AUX and SYM tags, not previously considered. Sejong KAIST POS to UPOS We also developed a mapping for the KAIST POS tag set, another widely used Korean POS tag set, to the UPOS. Unlike the Sejong POS tag set, the KAIST POS tag set is organised into a hierarchy comprised of four levels of tag granularity: 9, 22, 26 and 69 tags. We chose to work with the most fine-grained 69 tags as this set matches the most closely to the Sejong 45 POS tags. To map the KAIST POS to the UPOS, we first reviewed the Korean POS tags comparison chart 16 between the Sejong POS and the KAIST POS to identify differences. Where 1-to-1 mapping between the Sejong POS and the KAIST POS was identified, the same UPOS tag was mapped to both tag set. This represented 22 KAIST POS tags out of the 69 tags. Where 1-to-many mapping was identified (i.e., one Sejong POS tag corresponds to several KAIST POS tags), we reviewed the mapping to the UPOS. In most cases (39 out of 42), the same UPOS was mapped to both tag sets. For example, the Sejong NNP (proper noun) tag corresponds to four KAIST tags: NQPA (family name, e.g., '\ubb38'), NQPB (given name, e.g., '\uc7ac\uc778'), NQPC (family+given name, e.g., '\ubb38\uc7ac\uc778'), and NQQ (general 16 https://konlpyko.readthedocs.io/ko/v0.4.3/morph/#comparison-betweenpos-tagging-classes proper noun, e.g., \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d). These four KAIST tags were mapped to the UPOS PROPN tag as was the Sejong NNP tag. We examined more closely the three remaining cases. As mentioned in the section 3.2, the Sejong EC tag (conjunctive ending) covers three types of conjunctive endings (i.e., equal conjunctive ending, subordinative conjunctive ending and auxiliary conjunctive ending). In contrast, the KAIST POS tag set offers a specific tag for each of these conjunctive endings: ECQ (equal conjunctive ending), ECS (subordinative conjunctive ending) and ECX (auxiliary conjunctive ending). Therefore, we propose to map these KAIST POS tags with their corresponding tags in the UPOS: CCONJ, SCONJ and PART respectively. It is worth noting here that the mapping for the different types of conjunctive endings differs between Sejong and KAIST. It seems that the KAIST POS tags better aligns with the UPOS enabling the mapping to preserve as much information as possible. Finally, we identified five cases (MAD, JGT, JP, XSAM and XSAS) where there were no correspondences between the Sejong and the KAIST POS. The KAIST POS tag set offers more detailed categories that are not represented in the Sejong POS tag set. Taking into account the UPOS definitions and the KAIST POS guideline (Choi et al., 1994; \"KAIST POS Tag Set\",  2003), we mapped the MAD tag (demonstrative adverbs) to the UPOS ADV tag; the JGT tag (joint case postposition) to the UPOS ADP tag; the JP tag (predicative marker) to the UPOS ADP tag; the XSAM and XSAS tags (both adverb derived suffixes) to the UPOS PART tag. Table 9 shows the new mapping of the KAIST POS to the UPOS. Note that none of the KAIST POS tags were mapped to the UPOS X tag. Discussion Now that we have updated the Sejong POS mapping to the UPOS and proposed one for the KAIST POS, we discuss the impact this have on Korean NER task. We did not compare parser performances but instead we propose to illustrate the impact of this new UPOS mapping on NER task through a few examples. Our aim is to demonstrate the gain this new mapping enables by better identifying complex named entities, irrespective of individual NER system's performances. The most important change we made is to reduce the unnecessary use of the UPOS X tag, which is reserved for unanalysable words. We discuss below the impact of this change for the Sejong POS SL and SW tags. The examination of the SL tag usage showed that people can refer to entities both in Korean or their foreign correspondences. For example, the organisation named entity Samsung could be referred to by its English name ('Samsung') or by its Korean name ('\uc0bc\uc131'). Under the previous mapping, all foreign words were tagged with the UPOS X tag and would not have been recognised as proper nouns, and therefore, as named entities. Remapping the SL tag to the UPOS PROPN tag allows us to recover named entities that would have been ignored. Similarly, for more complex named entities (e.g., 'Samsung SDI'), we want to be able to capture the entity as a whole, irrespective of the language within which it is expressed (e.g., Korean, foreign or a mix of the two). As shown in Similarly, for more complex named entities (e.g., 'Samsung SDI'), we want to be able to capture the entity as a whole, irrespective of the language within which it is expressed (e.g., Korean, foreign or a mix of the two). As shown in Figure 4 , under the previous mapping, only entities expressed in Korean would have been identified. Again, remapping the SL tag to the UPOS PROPN tag allows us to recover named entities expressed in foreign languages (partly or in full). Currency symbol plays an important role in the identification of references to monetary amount in text. For example, in '$500' ($/SW+500/SN), the numeral value '500' is recognised as a currency value as it is preceded by a currency symbol '$'. Under the previous mapping, symbols were tagged with the UPOS X tag, thus it would have been difficult to recognise currency symbols. This would have resulted in missing money named entities or capturing it without currency symbols. Remapping the SW tag to the UPOS SYM tag allows us to recognise '500' as a monetary value, capture '$500' as a whole, and identify it as a MONEY named entity. As suggested by Park and Tyers (2019), the mapping for the Sejong POS tag set to the UPOS tag set can be applied directly to the Sejong corpus to build UPOS tagged training corpus for downstream NLP tasks such as NER. The same can be done to the KAIST corpus by using our new mapping for the KAIST POS tag set. Moreover, to develop new corpus for Korean, one could also use one of the Korean POS taggers tailored to either Sejong or KAIST POS tags and then convert the output to the UPOS using the new mapping scheme we propose. The mapping of the Korean POS to the UPOS can also be used to compare Korean parser performances. Although the KoNLPy 17 provides an easy access to various Korean parsers, it is not easy to directly compare their performance as they output different Korean POS tags (i.e., Sejong POS or KAIST POS). Conclusion When mapping a fine-grained tag set to a coarsegrained tag set, information loss is inevitable. While the UPOS does not capture as much information as specific Korean POS tag sets, it is a useful representation when working with a multi-lingual system. This paper proposes a new mapping for Korean POS tag set to the Universal POS tag set (UPOS), for the two most widely used Korean POS tag sets (the Sejong POS tag set and the KAIST POS tag set). It also discusses segmentation issues, provides explanation about the proposed mapping, and the impact this has on Korean NER task through qualitative analysis.",
