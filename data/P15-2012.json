Unlike existing resources of this kind, the resulting data set -the Zoom corpus of natural language descriptions of map locations -takes into account a domain that is significantly closer to real-world applications than what has been considered in previous work, and addresses more complex situations of reference, including contexts with different levels of detail, and instances of singular and plural reference produced by speakers of Spanish and Portuguese. Introduction Referring Expression Generation (REG) is the computational task of producing adequate natural language descriptions (e.g., pronouns, definite descriptions, proper names, etc.) of domain entities. In particular, the issue of how to determine the semantic contents of definite descriptions (e.g., 'the Indian restaurant on 5th street', 'the restaurant we went to last night', etc.) has received significant attention in the field, and it is also the focus of the present work. The input to a REG algorithm is a context set C containing an intended referent r and a number of distractor objects. All objects are represented as attribute-value pairs representing either atomic (type-restaurant) or relational (on-5thstreet) properties (Krahmer and Theune, 2002; Krahmer et al., 2003; Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006; Viethen et al., 2013) . The expected output is a uniquely identifying list L of properties known to be true of r so that L distinguishes r from all distractors in C ( Dale and Reiter, 1995) . Properties are selected for inclusion in L according to multiple -and often conflicting -criteria, including discriminatory power (i.e., the ability to rule out distractors) as in (Dale, 2002; Gardent, 2002) , domain preferences (Pechmann, 1989; Gatt et al., 2013 ) and many others. A description that conveys more information than what is strictly required for disambiguation is said to be overspecified (Arts et al., 2011; Koolen et al., 2011; van Gompel et al., 2012; Engelhardt and Ferreira, 2006; Engelhardt et al., 2011) . For a review of the research challenges in REG, see (Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012) . Existing approaches to REG largely consist of algorithmic solutions, many of which have been influenced by, or adapted from, the Dale & Reiter Incremental algorithm in (Dale and Reiter, 1995) . The use of machine learning (ML) techniques, by contrast, seems to be less frequent than in other NLG tasks, although a number of exceptions do exist (e.g., (Jordan and Walker, 2005; Viethen and Dale, 2010; Viethen, 2011; Garoufi and Koller, 2013; Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014) ). A possible explanation for the small interest in ML for REG may be the relatively low availability of data. While research in many fields may benefit from the wide availability of text corpora (e.g., obtainable from the web), research in REG usually requires highly specialised data -hereby called REG corpora -conveying not only referring expressions produced by human speakers, but also a fully-annotated representation of the context (i.e., all objects and their semantic properties) within which the expressions have been produced. REG corpora such as TUNA (Gatt et al., 2007 ) and GRE3D3 (Dale and Viethen, 2009) are useful both to gain general insights on human language production, and to benefit from data-intensive computational techniques such as ML. However, being usually the final product of controlled experiments involving human subjects, REG cor-pora tend to address highly specific research questions. For instance, GRE3D3 is largely devoted to the investigation of relational referring expressions (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006) in simple visual scenes involving geometric shapes, as in 'the large ball next to the red cube'. As a result, and despite the usefulness of these resources to a large body of work in REG, further research questions will usually require the collection of new data. In this paper we introduce the Zoom corpus of referring expressions. Zoom addresses a domain that is considerably closer to real-world applications (namely, city maps in different degrees of detail represented by zoom levels) than what has been considered in previous work, involving both singular and plural reference, and making extensive use of relational properties. Moreover, Zoom descriptions were produced by both Spanish and Portuguese speakers, which will allow (to the best of our knowledge, for the first time) a comprehensive study of the REG surface realisation subtask in these languages, and enable research on the issues of human variation in REG (Fabbrizio et al., 2008; Altamirano et al., 2012; Gatt et al., 2011) . Related work TUNA (Gatt et al., 2007) was the first prominent REG corpus to be made publicly available for research purposes. The corpus was developed in a series of controlled experiments, containing 2280 atomic descriptions produced by 60 speakers of English in two domains (1200 descriptions of furniture items and 1080 descriptions of people's photographs). TUNA has been used in a series of REG shared tasks (Gatt et al., 2009) . GRE3D3 and its extension GRE3D7 (Dale and Viethen, 2009; Viethen and Dale, 2011) were developed in a series of web-based experiments primarily focussed on the study of relational descriptions. GRE3D3 contains 630 descriptions produced by 63 speakers, and GRE3D7 contains 4480 descriptions produced by 287 speakers. In both cases, the language of the experiment was English. The domain consists of simple visual scenes conveying boxes and spheres. Stars (Teixeira et al., 2014) and its extension Stars2 were collected for the study of referential overspecification. Stars contains 704 descriptions produced by 64 speakers in a web-based experiment. Stars2 was produced in dialogue situations involving subject pairs, and it contains 884 descriptions produced by 56 speakers. Both domains make use of simple visual scenes containing up to four object types (e.g., stars, boxes, cones and spheres) and include atomic and relational descriptions alike. The language of both experiments was Brazilian Portuguese. Experiment We designed a web-based experiment to collect natural language descriptions of map locations in both Spanish and Portuguese. The collected data set comprises a corpus of referring expressions for research in REG and related fields. The situations of reference under consideration make use of map scenes in two degrees of detail (represented by low and high zoom levels), and address instances of singular and plural reference. A fragment of the experiment interface is shown in Fig. 1 . Subjects Volunteers were recruited upon invitation sent by email. The Portuguese data had 93 participants, being 66 (71.0%) male and 27 (29.0%) female. The Spanish data had 80 participants, being 59 male (69.4%) and 26 female (30.6%). Procedure Subjects received a web link to the on-line experiment interface (cf. Fig. 1 ) with self-contained instructions. Age and gender details were collected for statistical purposes. The experiment consisted of a series of map images presented in random order, one by one. Each map scene showed a particular location (e.g., a restaurant, pub, theatre etc.) pointed by an arrow. For each scene, subjects were required to imagine that they were giving travel advice to a friend, and to complete the sentence 'It would be interesting to visit...' with a description of the location pointed by the arrow. After pressing a 'Next' button, another stimulus was selected, until the end of the experiment. The first two images were fillers solely intended to make subjects familiar with the experiment setting, and the corresponding responses were not recorded. Incomplete trials, and ill-formed descriptions, were also discarded. Materials The experiment made use of the purpose-built interface illustrated in Fig. 1 , and a set of map images obtained from OpenStreetMap 1 , which consisted of selected portions of maps of Madrid and Lisbon to be presented to Spanish and Portuguese speakers, respectively. For each city, 10 map locations were used. Each location was shown in low and high zoom levels, making 20 images in total. In both cases, the intended target was kept the same, but the more detailed version would display a larger number of distractors and additional details in general. In addition to that, certain street and landmark names might not be depicted at different zoom levels. Half images showed a single arrow pointing to one map location (i.e., requiring a single description as 'the restaurant on Baker street'), whereas the other half showed two arrows pointed to two different locations (and hence requiring a reference to a set, as in 'the two restaurants near the museum'). Data collection Upon manual verification, 602 ill-formed Portuguese descriptions and 366 Spanish descriptions were discarded. Thus, the Portuguese subcorpus consists of 1358 descriptions, and the Spanish subcorpus consists of 1234 descriptions. In the Portuguese subcorpus, 78.6% of the descriptions include relational properties. In addition to that, 36.4% were minimally distinguishing, 44.3% were overspecified, and 19.3% were underspecified. In the Spanish subcorpus, 70% of the descriptions include relational properties, 35% were minimally distinguishing, 40% were overspecified, and 25% were underspecified. Underspecified descriptions are not common in existing REG corpora (i.e., certainly not in this proportion), which may reflect the complexity of the domain and/or limitations of the web-based setting. 1 openstreetmap.org Annotation Each referring expression was modelled as conveying a description of the main target object and, optionally, up to four descriptions of related landmarks. The annotation scheme consisted of three target attributes, four landmark attributes for each of the four possible landmark objects, and seven relational properties. This makes 26 possible attributes for each referring expression. In the case of plural descriptions (i.e., those involving two target objects), this attribute set is doubled. Every object was annotated with the atomic attributes type, name and others and, in the case of landmark objects, also with their id. In addition to that, seven relational properties were considered: in/on/at 2 , next-to, right-of, left-of, in-frontof, behind-of, and the multivalue relation between intended to represent 'corner' relations. Possible values for the type and name attributes are predefined by each referential context. The others attribute may be assigned any string value, and it is intended to represent any non-standard piece of information conveyed by the expression. For the spatial relations, possible values are the object identifiers available from each scene. The collected descriptions were fully annotated by two independent annotators. After completion, a third annotator assumed the role of judge and provided the final annotation. Since the annotation scheme was fairly straightforward (i.e., largely because all non-standard responses were simply assigned to the others attribute), agreement between judges as measured by Kappa (Cohen, 1960 ) was 84% at the attribute level. Both referential contexts and referring expressions were represented in XML format using a relational version of the format adopted in TUNA (Gatt et al., 2007) . Comparison with previous work Table 1 presents a comparison between the collected data and existing REG corpora 3 : the number of referring expressions (REs), the number of subjects in each experiment, the number of possible atomic attributes (Attrib.) and possible landmarks (LMs) in a description, the average description size (in number of annotated properties), and the proportion of property usage, which is taken to be the proportion of properties that appear in the description over the total number of possible attributes and landmarks. From a REG perspective, larger description sizes and lower usage rates may suggest more complex situations of reference. REG evaluation In what follows we illustrate the use of the Zoom corpus as training and test data for a simple machine learning approach to REG adapted from (Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014) . The goal of this evaluation is to provide reference results for future comparison with purpose-built REG algorithms, and not to present a complete REG solution for the Zoom domain or others. The present model consists of 12 binary classifiers representing whether individual referential attributes should be selected for inclusion in an output description. The classifiers correspond to atomic attributes of the target and first landmark object (type, name and others), and relations. Referential attributes of other landmark objects were not modelled due to data sparsity and also to reduce computational costs. For similar reasons, the multivalue between relation is also presently disregarded, and 'corner' relations involving two landmarks (e.g., two streets) will be modelled as two independent classification tasks. Only two learning features are considered by each classifier: landmarkCount, which represents the number of landmark objects near the main target, and distractorCount, which represents the number of objects of the same type as the target within the relevant context in the map. For other possible features applicable to this task, see, for instance, (dos Santos Silva and Paraboni, 2015) . From the outcome of the 12 binary classifiers, a description is built by considering atomic target attributes in the first place. All attributes that correspond to a positive prediction are selected for inclusion in the output description. Next, relations are considered. If no relation is predicted, the algorithm terminates by returning an atomic description of the main target object. If the description includes a relation, the corresponding landmark object is selected, and the algorithm is called recursively to describe it as well. Since every attribute that corresponds to a positive prediction is always selected, the algorithm does not regard uniqueness as a stop condition. As a result, the output description may convey a certain amount of overspecification. For evaluation purposes, we used the subset of singular descriptions from the Portuguese portion of the corpus, comprising 821 descriptions. Evaluation was carried out by comparing the corpus description with the system output to measure overall accuracy (i.e., the number of exact matches between the two descriptions), Dice (Dice, 1945) and MASI (Passonneau, 2006) coefficients. Following (Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014) , we built a REG model using support vector machines with radial basis function kernel. The classifiers were trained and tested using 6-fold cross validation. Optimal parameters were selected using grid search as follows: for each step in the main k-fold validation, one fold was reserved for testing, and the remaining k \u2212 1 folds were subject to a secondary cross-validation procedure in which different parameter combinations were attempted. The C parameter was assigned the values 1, 10, 100 and 1000, and \u03b3 was assigned 1, 0.1, 0.001 and 0.0001. The best-performing parameter set was selected to build a classifier trained from the k \u2212 1 fold, and tested on the test data. This was repeated for every iteration of the main cross-validation procedure. Table 2 summarises the results obtained by the REG algorithm built from SVM classifiers, those obtained by a baseline system representing a relational extension of the Dale & Reiter Incremental Algorithm, and by a Random selection strategy. We compare accuracy scores obtained by every algorithm pair using the chi-square test, and we compare Dice scores using Wilcoxon's signedrank test. In terms of overall accuracy, the SVM approach outperforms both alternatives. The difference from the second best-performing algorithm (i.e., the Incremental approach) is significant (\u03c7 2 = 79.87, df=1, p<0.0001). Only in terms of Dice scores a small effect in the opposite direction is observed (T=137570.5, p= 0.01413). We also assessed the performance of the individual classifiers. Table 3 shows these results as measured by precision (P), recall (R), F1-measure (F1) and area under the ROC curve (AUC). 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.28 left-of 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.27 in-front-of 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.42 behind-of 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.17 in/on/at 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.61 From these results we notice that highly frequent attributes (e.g., target type and landmark name) were classified with high accuracy, whereas others (e.g., multivalue attributes and relations) were not. Discussion This paper has introduced the Zoom corpus of natural language descriptions of map locations, a resource intended to support future research in REG and related fields. Preliminary results of a SVMbased approach to REG -which were solely presented for the future assessment of REG algorithms based on Zoom data -hint at the actual complexity of the REG task in this domain in a number of ways. First, we notice that a similar approach in (Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014) on GRE3D3 and GRE3D7 data has obtained considerably higher mean accuracy. This is partially explained by the increased complexity of the Zoom domain, but also by the currently simple annotation scheme. Second, we notice that Zoom descriptions are prone to convey relations between a single target and multiple landmark objects, as in 'the restaurant between the 5th and 6th streets'. Although common in language use, the use of multiple relational properties in this way has been little investi-gated in the REG field. Finally, we notice that the Zoom domain contains two descriptions for every target object, which are based on different -but related -models corresponding to the same map location seen at different zoom levels. Interestingly, the referring expression in a 1X situation may or may not be the same as in a 2X situation. Consider a map with higher zoom level (2X) as illustrated in the previous Fig. 2 , and the same map location as seen with lower zoom level in the previous Fig. 1 . The underlying models for these two maps are certainly different, but not unrelated. The map with 2X zoom contains fewer objects but may include more properties due to the added level of detail. The referring expression for the target in the 1X map may or may not be the same as in the 2X map. For instance, the referring expression \"the pub at Cowgate\" is underspecified on the 1X map, but it is minimally distinguishing on the 2X map. Differences of this kind are common in interactive applications (e.g., in which the context of reference may change in structure or in the number of objects and referable properties), and the challenge for REG algorithms would be to produced an appropriate description for the modified context without starting from scratch. REG algorithms based on local context partitioning (Areces et al., 2008) may have an advantage in this respect, but further investigation is still required.
