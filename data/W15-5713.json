We focus on the IT domain and on English to Portuguese machine translation, and compare different strategies for improving system performance over two baselines, the first using only large dataset of out-of-domain data, and the second using only a small dataset of in-domain data. Our results indicate that adding a domain-specific bilingual lexicon to the training dataset significantly improves the performance of both a hybrid MT system and a PBSMT system, while adding out-of-domain sentence pairs to the training dataset only improves the performance of a hybrid MT system. Furthermore, we perform a human evaluation of the sentences generated by the hybrid MT system and the standard PBSMT system built using the same training datasets. The results indicate some significant differences between those two MT approaches in this specific task. Introduction Although the problem of machine translation has been extensively studied in the last 30 years and is one of the main topics of the natural language processing (NLP), English to Portuguese MT is rarely addressed. Our work aims to fill that gap by addressing the problem of English to Portuguese MT for a specialised domain (the IT domain) using two MT approaches: the standard PBSMT system and a hybrid MT system based on deep translation approach. We focus on translation from English to Portuguese of short sentences taken from real-usage scenarios, where user questions are followed by answers from an IT technician. The data was gathered in a continuous way during user interaction with a technical support team via chat. We explore three different strategies for enlarging the training dataset: (1) adding an indomain bilingual terminology; (2) adding a certain portion of the out-of-domain corpus; and (3) adding both an in-domain bilingual terminology and a certain portion of the out-of-domain corpus. Our objective is to explore which of the three strategies leads to greater improvements in the system performance for each of the two MT approaches (PBSMT and hybrid MT). In order to gain a better insight into strengths and weaknesses of both MT systems, we also conduct a human evaluation and error analysis of their output sentences. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces studies that are relevant to our work; Section 3 describes the corpora, MT systems, experimental setup, goals and evaluation procedures; Section 4 presents and discusses the results of both automatic and human evaluation; and Section 5 summarises the findings of this study and gives directions for future work. Related Work The rule-based machine translation (MT) systems, such as Systran (Toma, 1977) , ETAP-3 (Boguslavsky, 1995) , and Lucy (Alonso and Thurmair, 2003) , required linguistic expertise to operate and were difficult to adapt to different languages. The emergence of the word-based IBM models (Brown et al., 1988; Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993) heralded a new approach to MT -statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. Later, the word-based SMT models were replaced by better-performing phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2007) or hierarchical phrase-based (Li et al., 2009) SMT systems. However, it was noticed that those shallow SMT approaches which do not use any deeper linguistic information or syntax are not able to capture long-distance dependences and may lead to problems with word order and grammatical and semantic cohesion (Fishel et al., 2012) . Shallow syntax-based SMT systems tried to address those issues using three different approaches: a tree-to-string translation, where linguistic information is applied only on the source side (Huang et al., 2006) ; a string-to-tree translation, where linguistic information is applied only on the target side (Galley et al., 2004) , and a tree-to-tree translation, where linguistic information is applied on both source and target side (Eisner, 2003) . However, for the majority of language pairs, phrase-based SMT systems still produce better results. The main limitation of SMT systems is that they require large amounts of parallel (or at least comparable) training data, which is hard to obtain for language pairs not covered by the Europarl corpora (Koehn, 2005) . Even if Europarl contains data for a particular language pair, another problem arises if the SMT system is needed for a different domain, as the training data may not cover the specific vocabulary or sentence constructions present in the targeted domain. In order to address this problem, many domain-adaptation techniques for SMT have been proposed, ranging from simply adding out-of-domain data to the small amount of in-domain data for training (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) to more sophisticated techniques, such as selecting only particular sentences from the out-of-domain data which are most similar to the in-domain data (Axelrod et al., 2011) or are similar to the sentences with the lowest translation quality (Banerjee et al., 2015) . Hybrid MT systems, in turn, aim to exploit the best of both SMT and rule-based approaches, usually either by combining rule-based transfer with statistical language models in the synthesis phase (Habash and Dorr, 2002) , or by combining rule-based with statistical approaches at different points of the Vauquois triangle, as the TectoMT system ( \u017dabokrtsk\u00fd et al., 2008) that we use in this study. English-Portuguese MT The English-Portuguese translation model built using the standard PBSMT system in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) , trained on the largest existing parallel corpora for this language pair (the JRC-Acquis corpus (Steinberger et al., 2006) ) achieves a BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) of 55% (Koehn et al., 2009) . The standard PBSMT system in the Moses toolkit trained on the Fapesp-v2 corpus of English-Brazilian Portuguese texts from the Brazilian scientific news magazine Revista Pesquisa FAPESP 1 (Aziz and Specia, 2011) achieves 46.28% BLEU score (Salton et al., 2014) . To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies reporting performances of English to Portuguese MT systems for any domain-specific tasks, neither have there been any studies comparing different MT approaches for this language pair. Methodology The next four subsections describe the corpora (Section 3.1), MT systems (Section 3.2), experimental setup and the main goal of the translation experiments (Section 3.3), as well as the human evaluation procedure (Section 3.4). Corpora We used four corpora in this study: 1. EP -Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) with English on the source side and Portuguese on the target side (1,960,407 sentence pairs) was used as the large out-of-domain corpus. Corpora Source (EN) 4. TERM -A parallel corpus of IT terminology (unigrams or multiword expressions), which consists of the Microsoft Terminology Collection 4 (13,030 terms) and a small portion of LibreOffice terminology 5 (995 terms). Examples from each corpora are presented in Table 1 . Systems This section describes the two MT systems used for the experiments. TectoMT TectoMT ( \u017dabokrtsk\u00fd et al., 2008 ) is a structural MT system which uses two layers of structural description, the shallow a-layer and the deep t-layer, performing the transfer on the t-layer (Figure 1 ). It encompasses three phases along the Vauquois triangle: analysis (which transforms the input sentence into the a-layer and t-layer in a two-step process), transfer (at the t-layer), and synthesis (which converts the translated t-layer representation to the a-layer and then to the output surface string). The analysis and synthesis phases are hybrid, while the transfer phase is mostly statistical, based on the Maximum Entropy context-sensitive translation models (Mare\u010dek et al., 2010) . In the analysis stage, all tokens from the input English sentence are first transformed into nodes in a labeled dependency tree (a-tree) to form a surface syntax layer (analytical layer or a-layer). This is achieved using various NLP tools that perform sentence splitting, tokenisation, morphological tagging, and dependency parsing. We follow the annotation pipeline used for the CzEng 1.0 parallel corpus (Bojar et al., 2012) , using the Mor\u010de tagger (Spoustov\u00e1 et al., 2007) and the Maximum Spanning Tree parser (McDonald et al., 2005) trained on the CoNLL-2007 conversion of Penn Treebank (Nilsson et al., 2007) . Dependencies are further transformed by the rule-based blocks into the a-layer which contains Figure 1 : Schema of the TectoMT system the corresponding word forms, lemmas, morphological tags and afun labels (which denote syntactic functions such as subject, predicate, object and attribute). The next step in the analysis stage is performed using another rule-based block that converts a-trees into t-trees (tectogrammatical layer or t-layer). The t-layer describes the input sentence according to the Functional Generative Description (GFD), and unlike the a-layer (which contains all input tokens), the t-layer only contains content words as nodes (t-nodes). Auxiliary words, such as prepositions, subordinating conjunctions or auxiliary verbs, become attributes of the t-nodes. This is illustrated in an example of the a-layers and t-layers in Figure 2 . The t-layer can also introduce new nodes (which did not exist in the a-layer), as for example, in the case of pro-dropped subject personal pronouns which do not correspond to any token in the input sentence. After the transfer of the English t-trees into Portuguese t-trees, the synthesis phase constructs a flat surface form of the sentence from the Portuguese t-tree. This is achieved using additional rule-based blocks which take care of word reordering, insertion of negations, prepositions, conjuctions, correct agreement, compound verb forms, etc. The synthesis stage for Portuguese uses the LX-Suite (Branco and Silva, 2006) to perform such tasks. The expected advantage of the TectoMT system over the standard PBSMT system is that the Tec-toMT translates t-tree nodes (and not the inflected forms) and should thus be able to generalise over the unseen morphological forms. This is particularly important for translation into morphologically rich languages (such as Portuguese) where data sparseness presents a problem for a purely statistically driven MT systems. PBSMT In all experiments, we use the same PBSMT model (Koehn et al., 2007) , GIZA++ implementation of the IBM word alignment model 4 (Och and Ney, 2003) , and the refinement and phrase-extraction heuristics as described by Koehn et al. (2003) . We tune the systems using MERT (Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003) ) and build a 5-gram language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing trained with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) on the whole target side (Portuguese) of the English to Portuguese Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) , which contains 1,960,407 sentences. Experiments In all experiments, the PBSMT system uses the in-domain IT1 corpus for tuning, and the language model (LM) is trained on all sentences in the Portuguese side of the Europarl corpus (EP) 6 . All experiments (in both TectoMT and PBSMT systems) are evaluated on the same test dataset (IT2). In order to obtain two baselines for each MT approach (TectoMT and PBSMT) we train both systems on: (1) the full Europarl corpus (EP) as the out-of-domain large corpus (BaselineEP), and (2) the IT1 as the in-domain small corpus (BaselineIT). In the next four experiments (IT+TERM, IT+EP1, IT+EP10, IT+EP10+TERM), we use the in-domain IT1 corpus as the basis for the training. As this corpus is very small (2,000 sentence pairs only), we explore three different strategies for enlarging the training dataset: (S1) Adding an in-domain bilingual terminology (the TERM corpus in the IT+TERM experiment); (S2) Adding a certain portion of the out-of-domain EP corpus (1,000 sentence pairs in the IT+EP1 experiment, and 10,000 sentence pairs in the IT+EP10 experiment); (S3) Adding both an in-domain bilingual terminology and a certain portion of the out-of-domain EP corpus (10,000 sentence pairs from the EP corpus and the TERM corpus in the IT+EP10+TERM experiment) Human Evaluation In order to better assess strengths and weaknesses of both approaches (TectoMT and PBSMT), we also conduct a human evaluation of the sentences generated by both systems for 100 sentence pairs from the test set for the IT+TERM experiments (which led to the highest BLEU score for the PBSMT approach and the second highest BLEU score for the TectoMT approach). Fluency and Adequacy We ask two native speakers of Portuguese (both employed as linguists) to evaluate the fluency and adequacy of the machine translation obtained by the TectoMT and PBSMT systems trained on the IT+TERM dataset. We follow the TAUS guidelines 7 , which suggest a 1-4 scale for both aspects. Fluency rates \"the extent to which the translation is well-formed grammatically, contains correct spellings, adheres to common use of terms, titles and names, is intuitively acceptable and can be sensibly interpreted by a native speaker\": 4 -Flawless 3 -Good 2 -Disfluent 1 -Incomprehensible Adequacy rates \"how much of the meaning expressed in the source is also expressed in the target translation\": 4 -Everything 3 -Most 2 -Little 1 -None Error Analysis Following the error classification proposed by Costa-juss\u00e0 and Farr\u00fas (2015) for evaluation of MT from Spanish to Catalan, we asked human evaluators to classify errors of each sentence into four classes: 1. Orthographic: punctuation marks, accents, upper-and lowercase, letters, joined/split words, extra spaces, apostrophe; 2. Morphologic: gender concord, number concord, verbal morphology (tense, aspect), lexical morphology (POS); 3. Semantic: polysemy, homonymy, incorrect meaning, untranslated words (left in the source language), missing words; 4. Syntactic: prepositions, relative pronouns, verbal periphrasis, clitics, articles, reorderings. Results The next two subsections present the results of the automatic evaluation of all experiments (Section 4.1), and the human evaluation and error analysis of the selected pair of experiments (Section 4.2). Automatic Evaluation The experimental setup for each experiment (the type and the size of the corpora used) and the obtained BLEU scores on the whole test set are presented in Table 2 . All four experiments (IT+TERM, IT+EP1, IT+EP10, and IT+EP10+TERM) of the TectoMT system significantly outperformed both baselines indicating that in the TectoMT approach both strategies (adding different portions of the out-of-domain corpus, and adding bilingual terminology) lead to significant improvements over the BaselineIT. The combination of both strategies (IT+EP10+TERM) resulted in the highest achieved BLEU score (significantly better than all others for the TectoMT system). For the PBSMT approach, the only two experiments which significantly outperformed the BaselineIT were those trained on the IT+TERM and on the IT+EP10+TERM corpora. This suggests that, for a PBSMT system, adding terminology has a greater impact than adding the out-of-domain corpus. In fact, adding a small portion of out-of-domain corpus (1,000 sentence pairs from EP) to the training dataset negatively influenced the system's performance, resulting in a BLEU score significantly lower than the BaselineIT. Adding a larger portion of the out-of-domain corpus (10,000 sentence pairs from EP) seems not to influence the system's performance significantly. Table 2 : Translation experiments setup -type and the size of the corpora used (the number of sentence pairs for the IT1, IT2, and EP corpora, and the number of unigram or multiword expression pairs in the case of the TERM corpus), and the results of the automatic evaluation (the results of the systems which significantly outperformed both baselines are shown in bold; the '*' marks the result which is significantly lower than the result for the BaselineIT; statistical significance is calculated using paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004 )) Human Evaluation Results The results of our human evaluation of the fluency and adequacy of the output are presented in Table 3 . For each sentence we additionally calculate the Total score (for each annotator separately) as the rounded arithmetic mean of its Fluency and Adequacy scores. The TectoMT system achieved significantly higher adequacy score and total score than the PBSMT system. The mean and median value of the fluency score in the TectoMT system was higher than in the PBSMT system, but the reported difference was not statistically significant (at a 0.05 level of significance using the marginal homogeneity test). The results of the error analysis of the output sentences are presented in Table 4 . The number of orthographic, morphologic, and syntactic errors was found to be significantly higher in the output of the TectoMT system than in the output of the PBSMT system, while the number of semantic errors was significantly higher in the PBSMT system. In order to achieve sentence-to-sentence comparison between the two systems, we calculate: Aspect 1. How many times was the output of the TectoMT system rated as better (TectoMT>PBSMT), equal (TectoMT=PBSMT), or worse (TectoMT<PBSMT) than the output of the PBSMT system; and 2. How many times did the output of the TectoMT system contain more (TectoMT>PBSMT), equal number (TectoMT=PBSMT), or less (TectoMT<PBSMT) errors of each of the four types (orthographic, morphologic, semantic, and syntactic) than the output of the PBSMT system. In this calculation, we compare the outputs of the TectoMT and PBSMT for each original sentence and each annotator separately, a total of 200 comparisons. The results are presented in Table 5 . It seems that the sentences generated by the TectoMT system tend to represent more fluent and adequate translation than those generated by the standard PBSMT system. However, the results also show that the number of cases in which the output of the TectoMT system contains more errors than the output of the PBSMT system is greater than the number of cases in which the output of the PBSMT system contains more errors than the output of the TectoMT system. These results indicate that either: (1) the fluency of a sentence cannot be well captured by counting its orthographic, morphological, and syntactic errors, and the adequacy of a sentence cannot be well captured by counting its semantic errors, or (2) the errors produced by the TectoMT system are not as severe as the errors produced by the standard PBSMT system, and thus were, not as severely penalised in terms of fluency and adequacy scores. Conclusions and Future Work The experiments presented in this paper address the problem of English to Portuguese machine translation of the domain-specific texts (text of the IT domain in this particular case), and report on results obtained using three different techniques to enlarge the training datasets for two MT approaches: the standard PBSMT approach, and the hybrid deep MT approach employed in the TectoMT system. Our results indicate that adding in-domain bilingual terminology, as well as adding a combination of in-domain bilingual terminology and out-of-domain sentence pairs, significantly improves the performance of both systems. Adding only some portion of out-of-domain sentence pairs, however, only improves the performance of the TectoMT system, while it either impairs or does not significantly change the performance of the standard PBSMT system. A human evaluation of the output generated by the PBSMT and TectoMT systems revealed better meaning preservation (adequacy score) in the TectoMT system. However, the error analysis showed that the TectoMT system led to a higher number of sentences that had a greater number of orthographic, morphological, syntactic and semantic errors. We acknowledge that both systems have room for improvement, and thus this work should only be regarded as preliminary. We used only the basic domain-adaptation technique for the PBSMT system, and no domain-adaptation techniques for the TectoMT. In future, the focus will be on implementing the state-of-the-art domain-adaptation techniques for the PBSMT system, as well as on exploring the possibilities of domain adaptation in the TectoMT.
