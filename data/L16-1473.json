If such a correlation exists, Twitter may be used as an alternative source for estimating viewer popularity. Moreover, the Twitter-based rating estimates may be generated during the programme, or even before. We count the occurrences of programme-specific hashtags in an archive of Dutch tweets of eleven popular TV shows broadcast in the Netherlands in one season, and perform correlation tests. Overall we find a strong correlation of 0.82; the correlation remains strong, 0.79, if tweets are counted a half hour before broadcast time. However, the two most popular TV shows account for most of the positive effect; if we leave out the single and second most popular TV shows, the correlation drops to being moderate to weak. Also, within a TV show, correlations between ratings and tweet counts are mostly weak, while correlations between TV ratings of the previous and next shows are strong. In absence of information on previous shows, Twitter-based counts may be a viable alternative to classic estimation methods for TV ratings. Estimates are more reliable with more popular TV shows. Introduction The social media platform Twitter 1 harbors enormous amounts of information, much of which refers to the personal realm. By referring to what one is doing, people provide information that can be used as a basis for research in sociology, demographics, and statistics. In this paper, we focus on TV ratings: how many people watch a certain TV program. Deller et al. (Deller, 2011) explore the reasons why it has become popular to use social media, such as Twitter, before and during the watching of TV programs: to suggest others to watch too, from a desire to talk about what they do, and from a desire to be part of a live conversation. Our main research question is: can we use Twitter to predict TV ratings? We present a case study focusing on Dutch TV. Similar research questions are discussed by Wakamiya et al. (Wakamiya et al., 2011) who use Twitter to estimate TV ratings based on textual, spatial, and temporal relevance. Oh et al. (Oh et al., 2015) conclude from their study that there is a positive relationship between social media activities and TV ratings. In their study, Sanders and Van den Bosch (Sanders and Van den Bosch, 2013 ) used a simple method to try to predict the outcome of the political parliamentary elections in the Netherlands in 2012, which worked surprisingly well. By counting the names of political parties and comparing them to polls and actual election results, they achieved a high correlation. Encouraged by this result we set out to apply a similar method to the prediction of TV ratings. In the remainder of this paper we first explain how we gathered the data we used in Section 2. In Section 3 we describe the experiments we conducted. In Section 4 we show the results from our experiments and in Section 5 we draw conclusions and discuss them. In the last section we provide some directions for future research. Data For our research we focus on Dutch TV programmes associated with a relatively high number of tweets, as these programs have the highest impact both in terms of economic relevance (e.g. for advertisement placement) and in total viewer time. The TV programmes were selected from the top-25 of programmes that are most tweeted about as listed on the website spot.nl. Spot is a foundation for the promotion and optimization of TV commercials oriented at the Dutch TV market. We only selected programmes broadcast once a week; the programmes are new shows, not replays. Generally speaking, these weekly programmes are also the type of programmes that are tweeted about most, in contrast to daily news broadcasts, one-off documentaries, children's shows, etc. and with these we minimize the risk that a tweet is about the previous or next episode of a programme (Cheng et al., 2013) . For our study we selected the top eleven most tweeted about programmes falling into the category of weekly shows. All programmes were broadcast between December 2013 and March 2014. Table 1 lists the eleven programmes. The TV ratings for all episodes of the eleven shows were obtained from the SKO, Stichting Kijk Onderzoek (English: foundation for TV-ratings). 2 The ratings are determined by acquiring information from devices installed in 1,235 randomly selected Dutch households that together monitor the TV watching behavior of 2,800 people. Every year the viewer panel is refreshed by moving a quarter of the devices to another household. 3  The numbers of tweets referring to a particular show in a particular week are obtained from the webservice Twiqs.nl 4  (Tjong Kim Sang and Van den Bosch, 2013) and has extensive search options. For our tweet collection we used simple time-specific search with the most commonly used hashtags for the TV programmes. Some programmes had two popular hashtags. Tables 1 and 2 list the hashtags used, the number of episodes, the type of show, the mean TV ratings per weekly show or episode, and the mean number of tweets. For reference, the daily number of tweets posted in the Netherlands is in the order of two million tweets; with a population of 17 million inhabitants, the Netherlands has a relatively active Twitter user base with about one million active users. The numbers in Table 2 suggest that only one in several hundreds of viewers is posting about the show during the show's broadcast. Method To investigate whether there is a relation between the number of tweets and TV-ratings, the correlation (Pearsons r) was computed for tweets and ratings in various conditions. In (Deller, 2011) the authors state that tweets about TV programmes are mostly posted when people are watching that particular programme. The best correlation is therefore probably the one between the TV ratings and the tweets that were posted during the broadcast. 5 Additionally we counted the tweets posted half an hour before the broadcast and half an hour after the broadcast. These appeared to be typical time slots within which there is already or still tweeted about the programmes. Table 2 compares the numbers of tweets posted during the half hours before and after the show with the numbers of tweets posted during the show, confirming the observation of (Deller, 2011) . Correlations were computed in two ways: 1. Per show, by taking the number of a tweets and ratings of all episodes together and computing the correlation over all data pairs. This yields one result. 2. Per programme / episode, by computing the correlation over the data pairs of the indiviual episodes of one programme. This yields 11 results. Results Figure 1 displays a scatter plot of the TV ratings against the number of tweets posted during all episodes of all programmes, as well as the best-fitting linear regression line. Pearson's r of this relation is 0.82(p < 0.01), which is remarkably high. Closer analysis tells that this is for a large part due to the 21 episodes of the two programmes that are viewed by most people, and that are much tweeted about: BZV and TVOH. If we leave out BZV the correlation drops to 0.44(p < 0.01) and if we leave out both BZV and TVOH the correlation reduces to 0.23(p < 0.01). Figure 2 zooms in on the next seven programmes of the top-11 that are viewed by fewer people than the top-4 programmes, i.e. the graph excludes all episodes of the four best watched programmes. From this figure we observe that there is at best a weak relation between the number of tweets and the TV ratings for these programmes. Figures 3 and 4 display scatter plots of ratings and tweets for tweets that were posted half an hour before the TV programme started, and half an hour after the programme has finished, respectively. The Pearson's r correlations are 0.79(p < 0.01) and 0.57(p < 0.01), respectively, indicating a better correlation between tweets posted before a show than posted after. If we leave out the numbers for BZV the correlations drop to 0.29(p < 0.01) and 0.41(p < 0.01), respectively. Table 3 provides the correlations between TV ratings and number of tweets averaged over all episodes of only that particular show. In general these correlation are low. Some even have a negative correlation, which is contrary to the effect we are looking for. Clearly, the number of tweets is not a good predictor for TV ratings for different episodes of one series. q q q q q q q q q q q q q 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 0e+00 2e+06 4e+06 Tweets during broadcast versus TV ratings, all programmes number of tweets TV ratings q q q q q q q q q q q q q q BZV TVOH WIDM Ikvertrek Flikken Moordvrouw TVK HBJW AMOV Divorce Proefkonijnen Tweets during broadcast versus TV ratings, excluding top 4 number of tweets TV ratings q q q q q q q q q q q q q Flikken Moordvrouw TVK HBJW AMOV Divorce Proefkonijnen Figure 2 : Number of tweets during the TV programme related to number of watchers excluding the 4 most viewed programmes. q q q q q q q q q q q q q 0 500 1000 1500 0e+00 2e+06 4e+06 Tweets half an hour before broadcast versus TV ratings number of tweets TV ratings q q q q q q q q q q q q q q BZV TVOH WIDM Ikvertrek Flikken Moordvrouw TVK HBJW AMOV Divorce Proefkonijnen q q q q q q q q q q q q q 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0e+00 2e+06 4e+06 Tweets half an hour after broadcast versus TV ratings number of tweets TV ratings q q q q q q q q q q q q q q BZV TVOH WIDM Ikvertrek Flikken Moordvrouw TVK HBJW AMOV Divorce Proefkonijnen Conclusions and Discussion We investigated how well TV ratings can be predicted from Twitter by counting hashtags referring to TV programmes. We observed the correlation between the number of Twitter mentions and the ratings of the 11 most popular weekly TV programmes in the Netherlands broadcast between December 2013 and March 2014. For the tweets that were posted during the broadcast of the programme, the correlation (Pearson's r) is 0.82, which can be considered very high. This is, however, for a large part due to the two most popular programmes. If we leave these out, the correlation drops to 0.23. The correlations with the tweets that were posted half an hour before of half an hour after the broadcast are show the same pattern, although their numbers are smaller. The interestingly high correlation of 0.79 for all shows for tweets posted a half hour before the shows start, indicates that anticipatory tweets of people posting messages about the fact that they are about to tune into a show correlate about as well with TV ratings as the larger number of tweets posted during a show. These results can be interpreted as implying that estimated TV ratings could already be publicized at the start of the show. However, the high correlation drops to medium or low correlation when the single or two most watched shows are left out. If we zoom in on Figures 1 and 2 , we see that for most TV programmes, the different episodes of one programme have similar TV ratings in general. In other words, the number of watchers for a programme are constant during the season. The correlation between the ratings of two following episodes is 0.98. Thus the ratings of a programme are predictable from the ratings of the previous episode to a high degree. The number of tweets about programme differs a lot between the different episodes. Therefore the correlation of the episodes of a single programme is low in general (table 3 ), or even negative for two drama (police) seriesthe latter may be due to special episodes such as cliffhanger episodes or season finales, which draw roughly the same viewers as other episodes, but trigger more reactions on Twitter. From these results, we conclude that predicting TV ratings from tweets is not as promising with this simple method as was the prediction of election results with a similar method based on hashtags and counts. The most popular shows stand out with the most tweets as well as the highest ratings, leading to a high correlation for the 11 most popular programmes overall. The larger shows bias this result, since for the other programmes a higher number of tweets does not always go together with higher ratings. Programmes that are less popular than these 11 are not expected to show a more positive result. Future Work We adopted a simple method to count the number of tweets relevant for a show; we just counted hashtags. Some improvements over this method are possible. A first step would be to take into account the other contents of the tweets. We may want to filter tweets based on their contents, in order, for instance, to only take those tweets into account that have a positive sentiment, as negative tweets may indicate the dislike of a show and may be indicative of the poster not watching the show. Another step of which we expect positive results is take the genre of programmes into account. In this way we would only compare programmes with each other that are in the same genre, such as talent shows, game shows, drama se-ries, documentaries, etc. This was ignored in these experiments; our relatively small selection featured weekly shows only, with a majority of game and talent shows but also drama (and police) series. We expect that some types of programmes generate a larger amount of tweets from the audience than others. Game shows in which candidates are voted off are known to be much tweeted about (see (Christopher Buschow, 2014) ). In future experiments we would need to enlarge our data set with more TV programmes and conduct per-genre analyses. We may look at non-weekly programmes as well, both of the daily type (such as the daily news) and the irregular type (such as sports events), as some of these tend to attract massive viewing numbers as well -also for these events we may prove to be predictive of viewer ratings ahead of the broadcast. Finally, we may want to use other types of social media and crowd-generated content, such as internet fora, to complement the Twitter stream as a basis for computing statistics. Not only is the Twitter stream quite sparse when it comes to numbers of tweets per episode of a show (cf. Table 2 ), the Twitter user demography may also be biased towards age groups, and other social media may offer complementary perspectives on TV from differently composed user groups.",
