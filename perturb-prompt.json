    "text": "Please conduct a thorough review of the provided academic article:\n\n{article}\n\nYour task is to identify and categorize the sources of financial support for the research detailed in the article. Systematically examine the document, paying special attention to sections typically associated with funding disclosures which include, but are not limited to, acknowledgments, explicit funding statements, grant information, mentions of financial support, and notes on partnerships or sponsorship.\n\nYou are to determine the presence of sponsorship from any of these specific categories: military, corporate, research agency, and foundation. Additionally, you must decide whether the article declares no external funding sources. Use contextual cues within the text when funding sources are not directly labeled.\n\nRecord your findings accurately using the structure provided below. Each funding category must have a response, marked as 'yes' if clear evidence is found in the article, or 'no' if there is no such evidence or if the evidence is inconclusive or absent.\n\nIn situations with multiple funding sources applicable to one category or if the financial support is implied to be from one of the specified categories but not explicitly named, please mark 'yes' for the appropriate category. However, in cases of uncertainty or if the information about a funding source is ambiguous or simply missing, you should err on the side of caution and mark 'no' for that funding source to maintain a conservative and reliable assignment.\n\nYour response must follow this exact template and include five lines, each corresponding to one of the funding categories or the potential lack of funding. If a category is confirmed as 'yes', you must still assess and respond 'yes' or 'no' for all remaining categories as well as for 'none'. Adherence to this structured response format is essential for the systematic analysis of funding sources and will help enhance the precision of your classifications.\n\nPlease use the following format for your response:\n\nmilitary: yes/no\ncorporate: yes/no\nresearch agency: yes/no\nfoundation: yes/no\nnone: yes/no\n\nEnsure that all decisions are evidence-based and recorded according to the guideline above, as this will facilitate an accurate and consistent analysis of the article's funding sources.",

    "text": "Please analyze the academic article provided here:\n\n{article}\n\nYour goal is to meticulously determine the origin of the research funding based on the information available in the article, focusing specifically on the acknowledgments, disclosure statements, or any dedicated funding sections. Establish whether the financing is sourced from any of the following categories: military, corporate, research agency, foundation, or if the project was internally funded without external financial support.\n\nConstruct your report using a standardized format to ensure unambiguous communication of your findings. For each potential source of funding, create a separate line starting with the category name, followed by a colon and a single space, then indicate presence of funding with \"yes\" or absence with \"no\". Maintain a strict one-category-per-line policy to uphold clarity in your report, which should consist of exactly five lines corresponding to the predefined categories.\n\nThe reporting format is as follows:\n\nmilitary: [yes/no]\ncorporate: [yes/no]\nresearch agency: [yes/no]\nfoundation: [yes/no]\nnone: [yes/no]\n\nInsert \"yes\" or \"no\" in the brackets as applicable, keeping in mind that \"none\" should only be marked with \"yes\" if there is explicitly no mention of external funding support. It is crucial that each line adheres to this listed format without any deviations.\n\nCommence the evaluation of the article's funding sources now, ensuring you acknowledge each funding entity that is mentioned. Conclude your assessment by presenting a structured confirmation or refutation of funding from each of the specified categories, in line with the instructions provided.",
