Here is an academic article:

{article}

Indicate whether the article was funded by each of the following funding sources: military, corporate, research agency, foundation, or none. Here are some examples of each funding source:

military: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Air Force Office of Scientific Research
corporate: Google, Pfizer
research agency: National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH)
foundation: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust
none: independent crowdfunded project, pro bono academic collaboration

Format your response with each of the funding sources on a new line, followed by a colon, then the word "yes" or "no" to indicate whether that funding was present. Your response should have exactly five lines. For example, this format is correct:

military: yes
corporate: no
research agency: yes
foundation: no
none: no

This format is incorrect because it uses the wrong separators and doesn't have the correct number of lines:

military - no,
corporate - yes,
foundation - no

What were the funding sources for the article?
