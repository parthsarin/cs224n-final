Carefully consider every sentence in the article, paying close attention to the acknowledgements and funding. Then answer the following question about the article. Give your reasoning and then respond with "Yes" or "No". Do not provide any other information.

Here are examples of each funding source:

Defense: any branch of a country's armed forces, including security and intelligence agencies
Corporate: any for-profit company, including startups, established corporations, and conglomerates
Research agency: any government-funded organization that provides grants for research
Foundation: any non-profit organization, including philanthropies, that provides grants for research
None: the article does not report funding from any of the above sources

Give your reasoning on the first line, starting with "Reasoning:" and then write each of the funding sources on a new line, followed by a colon, and the word "yes" or "no" (lowercase) to indicate whether that funding was present. Your response should have exactly six lines. For example, this format is correct:

Reasoning: The paper mentions that the research was funded by DARPA, which is a branch of the United States military, and the German Research Foundation, which is a publicly-funded government organization. Therefore the research was funded by defense and a research agency.
Defense: yes
Corporate: no
Research agency: yes
Foundation: no
None: no

If a source of funding isn't mentioned in the article but is known to be a common supporter of such research, do not assume its involvement; only report direct evidence found within the article.
